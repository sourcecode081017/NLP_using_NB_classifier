XGOALS OF THE CONTEST:
X
X    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.
X    * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code.
X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-)
X
X
XRULES:
X
X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules:
X
X    1) Your entry must be a complete program.
X
X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters
X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or }
X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.
X
X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:
X
X---entry---
Xrule:	1993
Xfix:	y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)
Xtitle:	title of entry  		    (see comments below)
Xentry:	Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)
Xdate:	Date/time of submission in UTC	    (see comments below)
Xhost:	Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested
X	Use tab indented lines if needed
X---remark---
X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if
X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a
X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th
X    column.  Blank lines are permitted.
X---author---
Xname:	your name
Xorg:	School/Company/Organization
Xaddr:	postal address
X	use tab indented lines to continue
X	don't forget to include the country
Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.
X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.
Xanon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)
X---info---
XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in
Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info
Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.
X---build---
XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program
Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting
Xfile must be 255 bytes or less.
X---program---
XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode
Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.
X---end---
X
X      Regarding the above format:
X
X	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*
X	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.
X
X	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should
X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,
X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.
X
X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect
X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() 
X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)
X
X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending
X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the 
X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same 
X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be 
X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.
X
X	* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above 
X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges
X	  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate
X	  Email message to the judges.
X
X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless 
X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.
X
X	* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for
X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and
X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.
X
X	* The entry's remarks should include:
X	    - what this program does
X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input)
X	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any
X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)
X	    - information about any ---data--- files
X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated
X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.
X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)
X
X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain
X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.
X
X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They 
X	  should not be required to exist.
X
X	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---
X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple 
X	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe
X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:
X
X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed
X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional
X	       digit, followed by '.c'
X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's
X	       title, possibly followed by a digit
X
X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your
X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a
X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of
X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed
X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.
X
X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must
X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.
X
X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be
X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,
X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this
X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.
X
X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.
X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not 
X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the
X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.
X
X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is
X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:
X
X		...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate
X		obfuscate@toad.com
X
X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.
X
X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries
X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however.
X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for
X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.
X
X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry
X       must be sent in a separate Email letter.
X
X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.  
X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed.
X
X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user,
X       special owner or group) are not allowed.
X

X10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest Guidelines, Hints and Comments
X

XAll Rights Reserved.  Permission for personal, education or non-profit use is

X
XABOUT THIS FILE:
X
X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).
X
X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about
X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.
X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.
X
X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.
X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.
X
X
XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:
X
X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c
X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.
X
X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C
X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers 
X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with 
X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor 
X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.
X
X
XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:
X
X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See
X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.
X
X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries
X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year
X    might be 'old' the next year.
X
X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply
X    a number of tests to an entry:
X
X	* look at the original source
X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII
X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines
X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines
X	* run it through a C beautifier
X	* examine the algorithm
X	* lint it
X	* compile it
X	* execute it
X
X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.
X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.
X
X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain
X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the
X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as
X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given
X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that
X    does something interesting when you run it.
X
X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave
X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life
X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the
X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.
X
X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know
X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse
X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the
X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to
X    annoy more than amuse.
X
X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries
X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use
X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)
X
X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make
X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly
X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some
X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.
X
X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that
X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off
X    documenting it.  Noting "this entry sometimes prints the 4th power
X    of a prime by mistake" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,
X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly
X    working entry is best.
X
X
XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:
X
X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We
X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests
X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far
X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.
X
X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:
X
X	#define d define
X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo
X
X	int i;
X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration
X	int k;
X
X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you 
X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in 
X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.
X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:
X
X	int i;
X	char *c;
X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead
X	(i+3)["string"];   <--- use "string"[i+3] instead
X
X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of
X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety
X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are
X    not portable and must not be used:
X
X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable
X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable
X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg
X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg
X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables
X	* using va_list as a structure or union
X
X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.
X
X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.
X
X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),
X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some
X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.
X
X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries
X    must not assume that it returns an int.
X
X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.
X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do
X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people
X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for
X    programs that are compact, and are instructional.
X
X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80
X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.
X
X    We tend to dislike programs that:
X
X	* are very hardware specific
X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific
X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific
X	      code is likely not to be)
X	* dump core or have compiler warnings
X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)
X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x
X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit
X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs
X	* are longer than they need to be
X	* are similar to previous winners
X	* are identical to previous losers  :-)
X
X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the
X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program
X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.
X
X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size
X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,
X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to
X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel
X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off
X    if you show some amount of restraint.
X
X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact
X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get
X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.
X
X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob
X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C
X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third
X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!
X
X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'
X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating
X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.
X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)
X    know of a smaller one!
X
X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that
X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't
X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend
X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.
X
X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and
X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client
X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the
X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).
X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone
X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not
X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or
X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better
X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.
X
X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on
X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines
X    in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    We like programs that:
X
X	* are as concise and small as they need to be
X	* do something at least quasi-interesting
X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)
X	* are portable
X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION
X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)
X
X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your
X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several
X    areas really does help.
X
X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in
X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to
X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.
X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.
X
X    Be creative!
X
X
XENTRY FORMAT:
X
X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your
X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,
X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the
X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)
X
X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to
X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that
X    is found in mkentry.c:
X
X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every
X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,
X	where this program differs from the contest rules, the
X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the
X	contest rules before submitting an entry.
X
X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,
X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check
X    the entry against the size rules.
X
X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about
X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below)
X
X    The following is a sample entry:
X
X---entry---
Xrule:	1993
Xfix:	n
Xtitle:	chonglab
Xentry:	0
Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993
Xhost:	Un*x v6, pdp11/45
X	2.9BSD, pdp11/70
X---remark---
X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.
X
X    It is likely not to win a prize.  But what do you expect from
X    a short example!

X
X    Typically the build file should assume that the source is prog.c
X    and will compile into prog.  If an entry wins, we will rename
X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,
X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional
X    digit in case of name conflicts.
X
X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,
X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.
X
X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source
X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the
X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful
X    if you did one of the following:
X
X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.
X
X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:
X
X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary
X
X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source
X		cp prog.c special_src.c
X		cc special_src.c -o special_name
X
X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build
X		tail +4 build > special_build
X		sh < special_build
X
X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of 
X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You 
X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.
X
X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,
X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid
X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should
X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This
X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.
X
X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We
X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the
X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them
X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,
X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,
X    then skip the ---info--- section.
X
X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that
X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an
X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample
X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a
X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a
X    'hints' file.
X
X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For
X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed
X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,
X    the entry should not require them exist.
X
X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name
X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,
X    say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they
X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say
X    so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has
X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should
X    have entry number 0.
X
X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry
X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the
X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't
X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the 
X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:
X
X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for
X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries)
X    
X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer 
X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as 
X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:
X
X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993
X
X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The
X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many 
X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:
X
X	date -u "+%a %h %d %T 19%y"
X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/'
X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'
X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'
X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'
X
X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set
X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.
X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number
X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be
X    replaced.
X
X
XJUDGING PROCESS:
X
X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.
X
X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message
X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:
X
X	---entry--- section
X	all ---author--- sections
X	all ---info--- sections
X	---build--- section
X	---program--- section
X	any other text, including the Email message headers
X
X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure
X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was
X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the
X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is
X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.
X
X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular
X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are
X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding
X    out in the end, who won and where they were from.
X
X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.
X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all
X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning
X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even
X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,
X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC
X    winners at talks)
X
X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the
X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give
X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their
X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We
X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.
X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.
X
X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,
X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;
X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does
X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the
X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.
X
X    A reading consists of a number of actions:
X
X	* reading the ---entry--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any
X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor
X	    shipping over any #include files
X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source
X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor
X	    shipping over any #include files
X
X    In later rounds, other actions are performed:
X
X	* linting the source
X	* compiling/building the source
X	* running the program
X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary
X
X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries
X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it
X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.
X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form
X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.
X    An entry often will compete in several categories.
X
X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries
X    we receive.  A typical category list might be:
X
X	* best small one line program
X	* best small program
X	* strangest/most creative source layout
X	* most useful obfuscated program
X	* best game that is obfuscated
X	* most creatively obfuscated program
X	* most deceptive C code
X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)
X	* best abuse of ANSI C
X	* worst abuse of the rules
X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>
X
X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so
X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.
X
X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10
X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into
X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is
X    less clear cut.
X
X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out
X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is
X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry 
X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, 
X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!
X
X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a
X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest
X    rules in some way.
X
X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such
X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the
X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.
X
X
XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:
X
X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,
X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to
X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.
X
X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:
X
X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources
X
X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following
X
X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc
X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x
X
X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See
X    below for details.
X
X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners 
X    have appeared in books ("The New Hackers Dictionary") and on T-Shirts.
X
X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)
X

X
X    In order to be included in this file for given year, we must
X    receive a current description no EARLIER than Jan 1 00:00:00 UTC and
X    no LATER than Feb 15 00:00:00 UTC.  Agreement to publish your

X    10th International Obfuscated C Contest   
X    
X	"The original obfuscated contest"
X
X    Obfuscate:  tr.v.  -cated, -cating, -cates.  1. a.  To render obscure.
X                b.  To darken.  2. To confuse:  Their emotions obfuscated 
X		their judgment.  [LLat. obfuscare, to darken : ob(intensive) +
X                Lat. fuscare, to darken < fuscus, dark.] -obfuscation n.
X                obfuscatory adj.
X 
X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST:
X 
X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.
X        * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code.
X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-)
X 
X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since
X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that mearly works
X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add
X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language.
X    (see "The New Hacker's Dictionary" by Eric Raymond)
X 
X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before
X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email
X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may
X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical
X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not
X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical 
X    closing date for contests are in early May.
X 
X    The contest rules are posted to comp.unix.wizards, comp.lang.c,
X    misc.misc, alt.sources and comp.sources.d.  If you do not have access 
X    to these groups, or if you missed the early March posting, you may 
X    request a copy from the judges, via Email, at;
X 
X        judges@toad.com   -or-   ...!{sun,uunet,utzoo,pyramid}!hoptoad!judges

X	By: Landon Noll & Larry Wall
X
X    This content is being planned.  Someday when Landon & Larry are not too 
X    busy, they will actually get around to posting the first set of rules!
X
X    Landon says: "Yes, I know that I said we would have a contest in 1993,
X		  but other existing projects got in the way.  Hopefully
X		  something will be developed after Nov 1993."

X                         Alena Lacova (alena@nikhef.nl)
X
X    A  contest of  programming skills  and  knowledge, exclusively  for the
X    PostScript programming language. Its purpose:
X
X    * To spread knowledge of PostScript and its details.
X    * To applaud those with the best tricks.
X    * To prove  that humans can  beat those damnable  machine generators at
X      their own game by writing  the most obscure and mysterious PostScript
X      programs ever.
X
X    Winners will receive the fame and attention that goes with having their
X    program entry posted as a winner to programmers world-wide.
X
X    The 1993 contest rules and results are available by ftp as
X    ``wilma.cs.brown.edu:pub/postscript/obfuscated*.shar'', or individually
X    in the obfuscated directory. The judges will post the 1994 rules
X    in November to comp.lang.postscript on Usenet, and other places.
X    Send questions to jgm@cs.brown.edu.
X
X    Categories include: Best Obfuscated PostScript, Best Artwork,
X    Most Compact, Best Interactive Program, Most Useful, and
X    anything so unusual and creative that it deserves an award.
X
X    The judges will choose the winners of each category.
X
X    Alena Lacova  is a system  administrator at NIKHEF  (Institute for High
X    Energy and Nuclear  Physics) in the  Netherlands. She is  the author of
X    The PostScript Chaos  Programs, which draw  Julia sets, Mandelbrot sets
X    and other kinds of fractal functions.

Last-modified: 30 Mar 1993

Note: This is a major re-organization (and replacement) of my
      "Frequently Asked Questions About X386" FAQ list.

This article includes answers to:

I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?
	1. Free options
	2. Commercial options
II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?
	3. What is XFree86?
	4. What OSs are supported?
	5. What video hardware is supported?
	6. What about accelerated boards?
	7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?
	8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?
	9. Where can I get source for XFree86?
	10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?
IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?
	11. Installation directories
	12. Configuration files
	13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes
	14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit
V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?
	15. SVR4
	16. SVR3
	17. 386BSD
	18. Linux
	19. Mach
VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?
VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?
	20. BSD compatibility library
	21. ANSICCOPTIONS

This article does NOT include answers to general X questions, since these
are already covered by the X FAQ that is regularly posted by David B. Lewis
<faq%craft@uunet.uu.net>.

If you have anything to add or change on the FAQ just let me know.
(especially if you had a problem that someone else was able to help you with)
Send changes to steve@ecf.toronto.edu, please put 'FAQ' somewhere
in the subject line so that my mail filter will put it in the correct
mail folder.

Please DO NOT ask me questions that are not answered in the FAQ.  I do not
have time to respond to these individually.  Instead, post your question
to the net, and send me the question and answer together when you get it.

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers)
=====================================================================

I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?

1. Free options
	The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.
	Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will
	be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86
	is listed below.

	X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was
	done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).
	It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.
	There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,
	X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you
	don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).
	X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).

2. Commercial options

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?

3. What is XFree86?

   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with
   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and
   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:

    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,
       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require
       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of
       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by
       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield
       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.
    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default
       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now
       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately
       20% faster than X386 1.2.
    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,
       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4
       with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from
       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.
    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.
       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about
       the ATI and Trident drivers.
    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's
       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).
    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is
       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the
       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.
    7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font
       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary
       distributions.
    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.
    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA
       cards is now included.

   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2
   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):

    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of
       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 
       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).
    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the
       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a "two
       headed" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only
       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).
    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.
    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to
       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for
       more information.)
    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some 
       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).
    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor
       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous
       documentation and a lot of experimentation).
    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including
       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many 
       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more 
       information).
    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has
       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of
       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks
       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.
    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig
       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative
       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new
       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) 
       manual page for more information on the format of this file).

       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file
       in the source distribution for full details.

   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the
   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.

4. What OSs are supported?

    XFree86 supports:
	SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2
	SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC
	SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2
	Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1

	BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active
	BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.

	Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,
	but anyone should feel free to submit patches.
	If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to
	xfree86@physics.su.oz.au

5. What video hardware is supported?

   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:

	Tseng ET4000
	Tseng ET3000
	Paradise PVGA1
	Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of
		the PVGA1, and use its driver)
	Genoa GVGA
	Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000
	ATI 18800, 28800

	All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,
	with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in
	256 color mode.

	The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of
	video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the
	ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome
	server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.

	It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to
	non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To
	avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86
	1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel
	clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are
	discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how
	these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such
	a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with
	future XFree86 releases.

	If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,
	it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the
	Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not
	work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.
	In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond
	products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions
	of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).
	If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.

	Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA
	video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the
	CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It
	could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset
	on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot
	of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested
	theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not
	working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86
	working fine on them.

6. What about accelerated boards?

	At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards
	like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available
	in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).

	An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact
	<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.

	A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>
	or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.

7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?

	The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the
	16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory
	contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-
	planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each
	of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-
	buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled
	16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code
	could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).
	But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer
	implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,
	but nothing is yet available from the project.

8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?

	Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run
	X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.
	The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending
	on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).
	To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will
	be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable 
	lower bound.

9. Where can I get source for XFree86?

	Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22
	from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:
		export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)
		ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)
		ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)
	(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)

	Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information
	on which files you need to get to build your distribution.

10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?

	Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:
		ftp.physics.su.oz.au		- SVR4 binaries
			under /XFree86/SVR4
		ftp.win.tue.nl			- SVR4 binaries
			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4
		ferkel.ucsb.edu			- SVR4 binaries
			under /pub/SVR4/XFree86
		stasi.bradley.edu		- SVR4 binaries
			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4
		blancmange.ma.utexas.edu	- SVR3 (ISC) binaries
			under /pub/ISC
		ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries
			under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86
		tsx-11.mit.edu			- Linux binaries
			under /pub/linux/packages/X11
		agate.berkeley.edu		- 386BSD binaries
			under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86
		ftp.cs.uwm.edu			- Mach binaries
			under /i386

	Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may
	archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will
	contain a README file that describes what files you need to take
	from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were
	made when building the distribution.

IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?

11. Installation directories

	The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot
	(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include
	files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.

	This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified
	via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is
	nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed
	alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.

12. Configuration files

	The XFree86 server reads a configuration file ("Xconfig") on startup.
	The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in
	the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.

13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes

	David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known
	clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.
	The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and
	is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is
	also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on
	export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated
	occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the
	settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to
	David for inclusion in the database.

	If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file 
	with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.
	It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use
	this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information
	to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.

	NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and
	      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot
	      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from
	      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The
	      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.
	      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your
	      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up
	      starting the server in the future.

14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit

	If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to
	reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is
	fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.

V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?

	First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).

15. SVR4
	Why won't my xterm run properly?

	If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define
	CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.
	csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'

	The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping
	problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be
	installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.

16. SVR3

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.

17. 386BSD

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.

	Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey
	<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the
	file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:

	    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2
	    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2
	    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2

18. Linux

	You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc
	jump libraries installed.

	Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.

	If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to
	run the server as "X -pn". The default startup configuration assumes
	that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files
	/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the
	-pn argument to X386.

	Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major
	number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not
	owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit
	console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but
	startx won't.

	When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with
	a tty, for example "xdm < /dev/console &".

	For more detailed information, please read the file README present
	with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.

19. Mach

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.

VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?

	This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is
	fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.
	Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.

VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?

20. BSD compatibility library

	A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.
	The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a
	which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),
	seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include
	<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro
	definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are
	linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these
	functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a

21. ANSICCOPTIONS

	This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the
	ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite
	the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see
	something like
		CCOPTIONS="-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings"
	and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put
		CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings"
	in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of
		ANSICCOPTIONS="-ansi"
		CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings"
	and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:
		ANSICCOPTIONS=
	to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death
	with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because
	CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must
	add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.

XFree86 Contact Information

    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86
    Core Team.  At this time the Core Team consists of:

	The original "gang of four":

0.  Xt Glossary
----------------------------------------------------------------------

o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code
  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with
  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,
  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,
  etc.  The terms "Xt" and "Intrinsics" are used interchangeably,
  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X
  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,
  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the
  Intrinsics are not especially useful.

o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The
  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It
  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the
  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless
  widgets or gadgets.

o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below
  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib
  functions because Xt provides most such services although an
  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for
critical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of
the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the
appropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a
list traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that
behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls
any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem
specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other
functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that
these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.

The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the
interrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a
work procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either
of these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous
to add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively
preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never
be called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop
about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler
can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.
However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.

Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it
is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating
system.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.

        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly
Volume 6 are in error.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has
three things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and
border pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap
resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions
deals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these
resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the
shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen
and DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is
not properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is
created.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends
on the visual being used.  

How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The
first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual
and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application
to start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier
because the basic information you need is available.  The first is a
little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit
yourself in order to determine the needed information.

/*
 * Some sample code to start up an application using something other
 * than the default visual.
 *
 * To compile:
 *	cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm
 *
 * To run:
 *	./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow
 *
 * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap
 * to install.

5.  Which visual should an application use?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is
no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to
be specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your
application probably falls into the category of always using the
default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular
visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some
such).

Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server
allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in
TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may
be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor
or just monochrome.

As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different
possible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static
color, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above 
plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary
widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the
shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that
shell.

A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have
its own realize method to use the visual when it calls
XCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be
obtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A
reasonable value is probably XtNvisual.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This
is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()
and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.
it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.

If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies
colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the
visual.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This was
especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

See section 2.8 of the Xt specification.

It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The
Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all
of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.
It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any
pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned
up before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then
performed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have
completed, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the
list is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among
other things.

As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the
Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the
widgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs
immediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on
the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not
destroyed until returning to the outer event loop.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting
an application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget
may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open
sockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for
simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):


	Widget
	ToplevelGet (gw)
		Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */
	{
		Widget		top;

		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))
			/* empty */;
		return (top);
	}

	void
	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)
		Widget		gw;		/* widget */
		XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */
		XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */
	{
		Widget		toplevel;

		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);
		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */
		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);
		exit (0);
	}

One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying
the toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never
occur.  

This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work
for those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that
since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the
reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant
of the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the
widget may change and someday require that some external state is
cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.

One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and
then test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private
event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and
difficult to maintain practices.

Try the following code instead.

	#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

	extern Widget ToplevelGet (
	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes
		Widget		gw
	#endif
	);

	extern Boolean ExitWorkProc (
	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes
		XtPointer	closure
	#endif
	);

	extern void ExitCallback (
	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes
		Widget		gw,
		XtPointer	closure,
		XtPointer	call_data
	#endif
	);

	Widget
	ToplevelGet (gw)
	Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */
	{
		Widget		top;

		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))
			/* empty */;
		return (top);
	}


	void
	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)
	Widget		gw;		/* widget */
	XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */
	XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */
	{
		Widget		toplevel;

		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);
		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */
		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);
		XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),
				  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);
	}

	Boolean
	ExitWorkProc (closure)
		XtPointer	closure;
	{
		exit (0);
		/*NOTREACHED*/
	}


ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the
application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are
processed and the destroy callbacks are executed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
11. How do I resize a Shell widget?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

After it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper
thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget
using XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the
Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the
request.  However, the Shell must have the resource
XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the
window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.

To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not
the child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does
not fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file
descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not
block, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to
block.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For
a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF
-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always
calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to
be read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based
OS's it is the poll() system call.

How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use
another process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe
to connect the application with this other process and pass the file
descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on
BSD systems is "tail -f filename".

It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_
reliable.  In particular:

	- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while
	  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other
	  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race
	  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.

	- Pyramid, doesn't work at all.

	- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as
	  sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing
	  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it
	  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at
	  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks
	  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having
	  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had
	  been given the whole block).


Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as
read(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and
may not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers
felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with
part of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this
point I don't know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective
it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full
details of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already
familiar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may
not find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which
means its a 1000 pages.

Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., "X Window System Toolkit, The
	Complete Programmer's Guide and Specification", Digital Press,
	1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by
	Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC
	Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL.

The other book I commonly recomend to novices is:

Young, Doug. "The X Window System: Applications and Programming with
	Xt (Motif Version)," Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).
	(ISBN 0-13-972167-3)

And of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt.
O'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt
reference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively
overhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it
very useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to
other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related
information.

I read two periodicals, "The X Resource" and the "The X Journal".
These are the only two dealing specifically with X.  "The X Resource"
is published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the
MIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no
advertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For
orders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial
matters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at
math.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in
~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.


"The X Journal" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising.
The articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical
audience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with an
expectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a
fairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good
collection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call
(908) 563-9033.

14. What Widgets are available?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three popular widget sets:

Athena	- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most
	  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is
	  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.
Motif	- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on
	  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but
	  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think
	  it is poorly implemented.
OLIT	- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets
	  implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by
	  AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.
	  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.

In addition the following collection of widgets are also available:

Xtra	- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software
	  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked
	  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,
	  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen
	  them so I can't comment.
FWF	- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of
	  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,
	  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets
	  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine
	  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.
Xcu	- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the
	  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for
	  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so
	  widely used.
Xs	- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but
	  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.
Xw	- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written
	  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.
	  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.
	  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was
	  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided
	  much experience for the designers of Xt.
Xo	- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you
	  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*

The following specialized widgets are also available:

Tbl	- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif
	  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl.
Plots	- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).
	  Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.

15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

	__________________________________________
	Name		Language	Vendor
	__________________________________________
	Xview		C		Sun
	OI		C++		ParcPlace
	Interviews	C++		Stanford
	Tcl/tk		C		sprite.berkeley.edu
	__________________________________________


However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and
implementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop
in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep
your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language
other than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)
	typdef struct
	{	
	    String	name;
	    long	value;
	} Arg;

and the code:
	Arg	arg;

	XtSetArg (arg, "name", 3.2)

expands to
	Arg	arg;

	arg.name = "name";
	arg.value = 3.2;

you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value
gets the integer "3" instead of the floating point value "3.2".  When
the value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is
wildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,
how to get around this?

The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now
recomending it over the previous suggestions.

#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \
    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \
        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \
    } else { \
        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \
        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \
    }


----------------------------------------------------------------------
17. How do I write a resource converter?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):

The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)
Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow
for destructors and caching of converted values.

There are several main types of resource converters:

    string to data type
    data type to string
    data type to data type

i) string to data type
    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings
    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often
    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:

	Name		Value
	"True"		1
	"False"		0

    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare
    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most
    readily accomplished by the use of the "quark" mechanism of the
    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,
    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a
    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the
    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.

    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many
    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then
    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the
    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of
    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks
    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one
    of the converters.

ii) data type to string
    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data
    type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,
    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,
    probably by the use of sprintf.

    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that
    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that
    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This
    mechanism can be used to provide a "snapshot" of application state
    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to
    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.

    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type
    converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to
    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure
    that they are consistent.

iii) data type to data type
    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type
    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be
    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for
    red, green and blue.


The type signature for a resource converter is as follows:

typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,
	XrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);
    Display *dpy;
    XrmValuePtr args;
    Cardinal *num_args;
    XrmValuePtr fromVal;
    XrmValuePtr toVal;
    XtPointer *converter_data;

When the converter is invoked, the "fromVal" argument points to the source
X resource manager value and the "toVal" argument points to the
destination X resource manager value.  The "converter_data" argument
is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified
when the converter is registered.  The "args" and "num_args" arguments
allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is
invoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed
above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the
Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.

Care must be taken with the "toVal" argument.  An XrmValue has the
following type definition and specifies a size and location for a
converted value:

typedef struct {
    unsigned int    size;
    caddr_t         addr;
} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;

When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of
the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.
In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the
destination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If
the destination area is not large enough, then the converter should
set the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The
caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the
converter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply
copy the converted value into the space given and return True.

If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to
the address of a static variable containing the converted value and
return True.

When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it
becomes convenient to define a macro:

    #define DONE(var, type) \
      if (toVal->addr) \
	{ \
	  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \
	    { \
	      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \
	      return False; \
	    } \
	  else \
	    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \
	} \
      else \
	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \
      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \
      return True;

    #define DONESTR(str) \
      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \
	{ \
	  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \
	  return False; \
	} \
      else \
	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \
      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \
      return True;

Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety
checking on the "num_args" and "args" arguments to ensure that your
converter is being called properly.

Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with the
Intrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating
widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.

To register a converter with a single application context, use
XtAppSetTypeConverter:

void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,
	cache, destructor)
    XtAppContext context;
    String from;
    String to;
    XtTypeConverter converter;
    XtConvertArgList args;
    Cardinal num_args;
    XtCacheType cache;
    XtDestructor destructor;

To register a converter with all application contexts, use
XtSetTypeConverter:

void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,
	cache, destructor)
    String from;
    String to;
    XtTypeConverter converter;
    XtConvertArgList args;
    Cardinal num_args;
    XtCacheType cache;
    XtDestructor destructor;

In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and
XtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter
and XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be
used.

When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a "cache" argument
specifies how converted resource values are to be cached:

    XtCacheNone		Don't cache any converted values
    XtCacheAll		Cache all converted values
    XtCacheByDisplay	Cache converted values on a per display basis

Caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a
good idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).

The "destructor" argument is a routine that is invoked then the
resource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has
been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is
being destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:

typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,
	XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);
    XtAppContext context;
    XrmValuePtr to;
    XtPointer converter_data;
    XrmValuePtr args;
    Cardinal *num_args;

The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated
with the "to" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed
to by the "to" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed
the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the
conversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments
for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to
free the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private
data passed in when the converter was registered.

Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT
R5 distribution:

    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c
    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c
    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h

18. How do I open multiple displays?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

See "Multi-user Application Software Using Xt", The X Resource, Issue 3,
(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues
involved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a
nutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_
application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display
and remove it from the application context.

The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can
happen 3 ways:
	1. User selects a "quit" button on one of the displays,
	2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,
	3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,
	   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.

I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a
problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that
display.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.

The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the
Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult
problem.

The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O
error is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true
for a single display X based application, but not true for a
multiple display program or an application that does things other than
display information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the
I/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()
happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid
returning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment
demonstrates this:

#include <setjmp.h>
jmp_buf XIOrecover;

void
XIOHandler (dpy)
	Display		*dpy;
{
	destroyDisplay (dpy);
	longjmp (XIOrecover, 1);
}

main ()
{
	...
	if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)
		XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);
	XtAppMainLoop (app_context);
}

The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go
back to the application specific data and perform any necessary
cleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().

For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is
first called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the
jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to
the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value
of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to
longjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this
purpose it is adequate.

Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that
improperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors
such as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the
total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited
number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical
value.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to
connect to a display.

There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in
November of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically
said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This addresses only changes in the Intrinsics.  First, the general
changes for each release are described.  Then a, certainly incomplete,
list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated are
listed.  Brevity is a primary goal.

Much of the following information is retrieved from Chapter 13 of the MIT
Xt Intrinsics Manual and from O'Reilly Volume 5, 3rd edition.

- Addition of gadgets (windowless widgets)
- New resource type converter interface to handle cacheing and
  additional  data.
- Variable argument list interface.

	  avoid string copies.  Several fields in the class record are
	  indicated as needing permanent strings.
	- Using an array of Strings for resources
	- Callback lists redesigned to use less memory
	- Translation manager redesigned and rewritten so it takes
	  less memory, translation tables merges are faster, cache of

	- Better sharing of GC's with modifiable fields
	- Window to Widget translation uses less space and faster
	- Does not malloc space for widget name since quark is available
	- Widget space is allocated to include the constraints

----------------------------------------------------------------------
20. Where are the resources loaded from?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places
(from highest priority to lowest priority):

	1. Args passed at creation time.
	2. Command line arguments.
	3. User's per host defaults file
	4. User's defaults file.
	5. User's per application default file.
	6. System wide per application default file.

Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result
of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.

The per host defaults file contains customizations for all
applications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either
specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not
set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.

The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER
property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then
the file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program "xrdb" is
used to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this
should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the
display must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is
reasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER
but most do not.

A user may have many per application default files containing
customizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite
flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes
the various environment variables and how they effect where this file
is found.

The system wide per application default files are typically found in
/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the
fallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how
this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various
environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.

[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]

You can use several environment variables to control how resources are
loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables
control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an
application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file
from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path
defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.

Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a
way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory
hierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open
Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in
/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for
XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files
in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your
OPENWINHOME is located):

	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N

The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of
pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows
(see XtResolvePathname()):

	%N	The value of the filename parameter, or the
		application's class name.
	%T	The value of the file "type".  In this case, the
		literal string "app-defaults"
	%C	customization resource (R5 only)
	%S	Suffix.  None for app-defaults.
	%L	Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. "ja_JP.EUC")
	%l	Language part of %L  (e.g. "ja")
	%t	The territory part of the display's language string
	%c	The codeset part of the display's language string

Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is
"Myterm". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.
(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)

	/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm
	$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm

As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above
app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it
reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of
this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.

Let's consider another example. This time, let's set
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current
working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.

	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N

The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands
to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for
debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the
app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so
you can run the application from the directory in which you are
working and still have the resources loaded properly.

NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,
      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is
      defined so %T and %S are useless.

With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization
resource value.  For example, you might run the "myterm" application
like this:

	myterm -xrm "*customization: -color"

If one of your pathname specifications had the value
"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C" then the expanded pathname would be
"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color" because the %C substitution
character takes on the value of the customization resource.

The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:

		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\
		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\
		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N

(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this
batch of default settings.)

The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is 

		<root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5)
		<root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5)
		<root>/%N%C:\     (R5)
		<root>/%L/%N:\
		<root>/%l/%N:\
		<root>/%N:

<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory
if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some
value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.

Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find
your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set
XAPPLRESDIR to ".", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked
differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR
value to "./", a dot followed by a slash.

21. What order are callbacks executed in?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)

The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because
both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to
modify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one
currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot
guarantee the order of execution.

The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the
widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and
remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;
therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be
independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the
list.

Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback
says:

 	"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the
 	procedure is to be appended."
 
you may not infer from the word "appended" that the callback routines
are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback
list.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
22. How do I know if a widget is visible?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)

> I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible
> interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core
> visible flag goes FALSE. However, if my window is iconified, the flag
> stays set to TRUE.

Right, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a "deficiency"
in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the
protocol.  (The "deficiency" is that the information is available in one way,
in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in
the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section
carefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.

A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from
viewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;
that is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.
Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;
see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.

> Is this a problem with "mwm" or is there something
> else which needs to be done?

You'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.

> If the problem is "mwm", what is the fastest
> way to determine if a window is iconified? 

As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action
routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget
which contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the
map_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are
suggestions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can't.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()
tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is
handled something like:

	ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))
	if (!ptr)
	{
		perror ("malloc in xyzzy()");
		exit (1)
	}
To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions
XtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which
all use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and
realloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt
error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.

In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses
XtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:

	if (!ptr)
		ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));
	else
		ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));
	++count;

to be written as:

	ptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);

Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've
found the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm
allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so
I can fully recover from not enough memory errors.

XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a
structure or copying a string:

	  struct abc *xyzzy;
	  char	     *ptr;
	  char	     *str = "abcdef";

	  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);	/* takes care of type casting */
	  ptr = XtNewString (str);

A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an
implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with
malloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:

	 char	      *ptr;

	 ptr = XtMalloc (100);
	 /* ... */
	 free (ptr);

may not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this
broken and complain to the vendor.

A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string
when they should really be using XmStringFree().

----------------------------------------------------------------------
25. How to debug an Xt application?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
First, I'd recomend getting "purify" from Pure Software.  This is a
great package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey
at $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb
(contact support@pure.com for more info).

	Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into
	the object code produced by existing compilers.  These
	instructions check every memory read and write performed by
	the program under test and detect several types of access
	errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past
	malloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts
	checking logic into all of the code in a program, including
	third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies
	system call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory
	usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel
	adaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly
	comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program
	down typically by a factor of two to five.

An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on
many Unix's and has pretty similar features is "The SENTINEL Debugging
Environment".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library
functions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com
for more info)

Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in
synchronous mode, easily accomplished with the "-sync" command line
argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then
set a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the
original Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous
mode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to
Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the
server are asynchronous.

Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the
undocumented resource "xtIdentifyWindows" or the class resource
"XtDebug" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.
For example:

    example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &
    example% xwininfo -tree
	     <click in new xload window>

will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each
window is included.  This can help for checking the location and size
of errant widgets.

Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to
test the way a widget manages it's children, you can try
export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter
between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour
of both.  It's a very clever idea.

The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the
application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from
a pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to
go to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server
locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else
can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped
waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.
Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to
your application which is stopped.

The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on
your desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)
on one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly
using a command sequence like this:

	othermachine% xhost +thismachine
	thismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;
	thismachine% gdb application	# Your favorite debugger.
	or this:
	othermachine% xhost +thismachine
	thismachine% gdb application
	(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0
	(gdb) run ...

I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method
of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to
release any grabs during breakpoints.

Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and
knowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing
the internals of a particular widget but not very far without
understanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional
breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great
deal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,
   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when
   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.
   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works
   perfect, but in my "real" application nothing happens. 

The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those
routines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is
they use a default application context different then the one you may
have created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per
application context basis and you are using two application contexts,
you won't get those events.

For example:

	...
	cnt = 0;
	toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,
				   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),
				   &argc, argv,
				   Fallback, args, cnt);

	XtAddTimeOut (...)
	XtAddWorkProc (...)

	XtAppMainLoop (app)

would never invoke the timeout.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)

Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an
``intuitive'' fashion.

Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has
supported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with
each other, and so far as I know, they are not published.

I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public
protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My
intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to
support a "standard" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop
and contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long
as it is based on Xt).

The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM
conventions, for more details read the code.

I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that
it works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to
be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif
anyway.

The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from
netcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also
available on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib.

I don't know a great deal about the support for C++ in UIM/X, but I can tell 
you that there is good support for it in TeleUSE.  In TeleUSE you can call any
C++ method from a "D" module.  What you can do then is to use the "D" language
for most of your interface code and then use C++ for you application code.

I should tell you that there is some real neat stuff coming out of TeleUSE soon
in regard to C++, but I can't give you many details.  You should talk to your local sales rep and get the lowdown on what they will be doing in the near furture.

If you want example code of how C++ integrates with TeleUSE you should look at
$TeleUSE/examples/Thermometer

On a related note, how can I use xv to display colored GIFs on my
root display with HP Vue?

All I can do with Vue is display xbm's through their
Backdrop Style Manager.

xv does not seem to be able to override whatever Vue
puts there.

Thanks, Jan

Hi, 

I'm trying to write a Motif program on an Interactive Unix machine, and I'm
observing very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose a
DrawingArea. Namely, some Xlib operations work, and some do not. In
particular, the expose consist of two XFillRectangle calls followed by some
XDrawPoint calls, and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing
whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is (clicked on and) moved in the
rightward direction over the drawing area, but after the move, is still on
some part of the drawing area. This also happens less consistently when the
pulldown/popup is moved in the leftward direction.

Assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd, is this a server
bug?

Thanks,

Zack T. Smith

I have heard of two packages for the PC that support X-Win.
The first is Linux which is a free Unix Package.  The Second
is X-Appeal, which sounds pretty good.  It can be found at
 garbo.uwusa.fi in the ~ftp/pc/demo/ dir.  The files are

	xap13exe.zip
	xap10fon.zip
	drivers.zip

This should get you started.

Josh.

I'm writing 'xwall', a simple X version of 'wall', and I want it to
put a message up on each of a default list of displays.  The problem
is that XOpenDisplay hangs if one of the displays is currently
controlled by xdm (login screen).   I've been through the manuals
and FAQ and don't see a simple way to see if a display is 'openable'
ahead of time, or to get XOpenDisplay to fail after a short period
of time.  Any hints, suggestions, clues, or pointers to info?  Thanks...

I have looked through the FAQ sections and have not
seen a answer for this.

I have an X/Motif application that I have written.
I have a couple of gif files (or pict) that I have
scanned in with a color scanner.  Now I would like
to be able to convert the gif files into a format
that could be read into my application and displayed
on the background of its main window. Preferably with
pixmaps, or perhaps as an XImage.

I have found functions in the pbmplus program suite
to convert gif to xbm, but that is monochrome, and
I really do need color.

I have looked at xv, which reads in gif, and writes
out several formats, but have not found a way to write
out a file which can be read in as a pixmap.

Is there an easy way to do this?

email responses preferred.

thanks!

We have received a number of requests for a reposting of the
International Obfuscated C Code Contest rules and guidelines.  Also
some people requested that these rules be posted to a wider set of
groups.  Sorry for the cross posting.

Some technical clarifications were made to the rules and guidelines
(See the diff marks at the right hand edge).  The rules and guidelines
for this year remain the same, so people who have already or are
in the process of submitting entries for the 1993 IOCCC need not worry 
about these changes.

X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,
X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.
X
X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect
X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()
X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)
X
X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending
X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the
X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same
X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be
X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.
X
X	* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above
X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges
X	  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate
X	  Email message to the judges.
X
X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless
X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.
X
X	* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for
X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and
X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.
X
X	* The entry's remarks should include:
X	    - what this program does
X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input)
X	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any
X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)
X	    - information about any ---data--- files
X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated
X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.
X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)
X
X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain
X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.
X
X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They
X	  should not be required to exist.
X
X	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---
X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple
X	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe
X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:
X
X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed
X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional
X	       digit, followed by '.c'
X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's
X	       title, possibly followed by a digit
X
X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your
X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a
X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of
X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed
X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.
X
X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must
X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.
X
X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be
X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,
X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this
X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.
X
X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.
X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not
X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the
X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.
X
X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is
X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:
X
X		...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate
X		obfuscate@toad.com
X
X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.
X
X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries
X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however.
X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for
X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.
X
X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry
X       must be sent in a separate Email letter.
X
X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.
X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed.
X
X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user,
X       special owner or group) are not allowed.

XABOUT THIS FILE:
X
X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).
X
X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about
X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.
X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.
X
X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.
X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.
X
X    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->		      |
X
X
XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:
X
X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c
X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.
X
X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C
X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers
X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with
X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor
X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.
X
X
XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:
X
X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See
X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.
X
X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries
X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year
X    might be 'old' the next year.
X
X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply
X    a number of tests to an entry:
X
X	* look at the original source
X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII
X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines
X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines
X	* run it through a C beautifier
X	* examine the algorithm
X	* lint it
X	* compile it
X	* execute it
X
X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.
X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.
X
X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain
X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the
X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as
X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given
X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that
X    does something interesting when you run it.
X
X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave
X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life
X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the
X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.
X
X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know
X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse
X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the
X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to
X    annoy more than amuse.
X
X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries
X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use
X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)
X
X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make
X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly
X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some
X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.
X
X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that
X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off
X    documenting it.  Noting "this entry sometimes prints the 4th power
X    of a prime by mistake" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,
X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly
X    working entry is best.
X
X
XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:
X
X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We
X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests
X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far
X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.
X
X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:
X
X	#define d define
X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo
X
X	int i;
X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration
X	int k;
X
X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you
X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in
X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       |
X    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    |
X    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.	      |
X
X	int i;
X	char *c;
X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead
X	(i+3)["string"];   <--- use "string"[i+3] instead
X
X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of
X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety
X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are
X    not portable and must not be used:
X
X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable
X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable
X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg
X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg
X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables
X	* using va_list as a structure or union
X
X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.
X
X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.
X
X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),
X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some
X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.
X
X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries
X    must not assume that it returns an int.
X
X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.
X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do
X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people
X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for
X    programs that are compact, and are instructional.
X
X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80
X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.
X
X    We tend to dislike programs that:
X
X	* are very hardware specific
X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific
X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific
X	      code is likely not to be)
X	* dump core or have compiler warnings
X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)
X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x
X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit
X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs
X	* are longer than they need to be
X	* are similar to previous winners
X	* are identical to previous losers  :-)
X
X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the
X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program
X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.
X
X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size
X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,
X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to
X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel
X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off
X    if you show some amount of restraint.
X
X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact
X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get
X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.
X
X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob
X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C
X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third
X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!
X
X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'
X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating
X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.
X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)
X    know of a smaller one!
X
X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that
X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't
X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend
X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.
X
X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and
X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client
X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the
X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).
X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone
X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not
X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or
X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better
X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.
X
X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on
X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines
X    in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    We like programs that:
X
X	* are as concise and small as they need to be
X	* do something at least quasi-interesting
X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)
X	* are portable
X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION
X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)
X
X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your
X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several
X    areas really does help.
X
X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in
X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to
X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.
X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.
X
X    Be creative!
X
X
XENTRY FORMAT:
X
X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your
X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,
X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the
X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)
X
X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to
X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that
X    is found in mkentry.c:
X
X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every
X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,
X	where this program differs from the contest rules, the
X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the
X	contest rules before submitting an entry.
X
X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,
X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check
X    the entry against the size rules.
X
X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about
X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below)
X
X    The following is a sample entry:
X
X---entry---
Xrule:	1993
Xfix:	n
Xtitle:	chonglab
Xentry:	0
Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993
Xhost:	Un*x v6, pdp11/45
X	2.9BSD, pdp11/70
X---remark---
X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.
X
X    It is likely not to win a prize.  But what do you expect from
X    a short example!

X
X    Typically the build file should assume that the source is prog.c
X    and will compile into prog.  If an entry wins, we will rename
X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,
X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional
X    digit in case of name conflicts.
X
X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,
X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.
X
X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source
X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the
X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful
X    if you did one of the following:
X
X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.
X
X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:
X
X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary
X
X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source
X		cp prog.c special_src.c
X		cc special_src.c -o special_name
X
X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build
X		tail +4 build > special_build
X		sh < special_build
X
X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of
X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You
X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.
X
X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,
X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid
X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should
X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This
X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.
X
X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We
X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the
X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them
X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,
X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,
X    then skip the ---info--- section.
X
X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that
X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an
X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample
X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a
X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a
X    'hints' file.
X
X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For
X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed
X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,
X    the entry should not require them exist.
X
X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name
X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,
X    say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they
X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say
X    so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has
X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should
X    have entry number 0.
X
X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry
X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the
X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't
X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the
X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:
X
X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for
X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries)
X
X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer
X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as
X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:
X
X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993
X
X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The
X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many
X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:
X
X	date -u "+%a %h %d %T 19%y"
X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/'
X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'
X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'
X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'
X
X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set
X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.
X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number
X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be
X    replaced.
X
X
XJUDGING PROCESS:
X
X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.
X
X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message
X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:
X
X	---entry--- section
X	all ---author--- sections
X	all ---info--- sections
X	---build--- section
X	---program--- section
X	any other text, including the Email message headers
X
X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure
X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was
X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the
X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is
X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.
X
X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular
X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are
X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding
X    out in the end, who won and where they were from.
X
X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.
X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all
X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning
X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even
X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,
X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC
X    winners at talks)
X
X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the
X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give
X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their
X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We
X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.
X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.
X
X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,
X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;
X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does
X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the
X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.
X
X    A reading consists of a number of actions:
X
X	* reading the ---entry--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any
X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor
X	    shipping over any #include files
X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source
X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor
X	    shipping over any #include files
X
X    In later rounds, other actions are performed:
X
X	* linting the source
X	* compiling/building the source
X	* running the program
X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary
X
X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries
X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it
X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.
X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form
X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.
X    An entry often will compete in several categories.
X
X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries
X    we receive.  A typical category list might be:
X
X	* best small one line program
X	* best small program
X	* strangest/most creative source layout
X	* most useful obfuscated program
X	* best game that is obfuscated
X	* most creatively obfuscated program
X	* most deceptive C code
X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)
X	* best abuse of ANSI C
X	* worst abuse of the rules
X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>
X
X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so
X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.
X
X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10
X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into
X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is
X    less clear cut.
X
X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out
X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is
X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry
X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,
X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!
X
X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a
X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest
X    rules in some way.
X
X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such
X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the
X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.
X
X
XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:
X
X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,
X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to
X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.
X
X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:
X
X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources
X
X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following
X
X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc
X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x
X
X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See
X    below for details.
X
X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners
X    have appeared in books ("The New Hackers Dictionary") and on T-Shirts.
X
X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)

We have received a number of requests for a reposting of the
International Obfuscated C Code Contest rules and guidelines.  Also
some people requested that these rules be posted to a wider set of
groups.  Sorry for the cross posting.

Some technical clarifications were made to the rules and guidelines.
(See the diff marks at the right hand edge)  The rules and guidelines
for this year remain the same, so people who have already or are
in the process of submitting entries for the 1993 IOCCC need not worry 
about these changes.

X    10th International Obfuscated C Contest
X
X	"The original obfuscated contest"
X
X    Obfuscate:  tr.v.  -cated, -cating, -cates.  1. a.  To render obscure.
X                b.  To darken.  2. To confuse:  Their emotions obfuscated
X		their judgment.  [LLat. obfuscare, to darken : ob(intensive) +
X                Lat. fuscare, to darken < fuscus, dark.] -obfuscation n.
X                obfuscatory adj.
X
X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST:
X
X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.
X        * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code.
X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-)
X
X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since
X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works
X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add
X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language.
X    (see "The New Hacker's Dictionary" by Eric Raymond)
X
X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before
X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email
X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may
X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical
X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not
X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical
X    closing date for contests are in early May.
X
X    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to
X    year.  You should be sure you have the current rules and guidelines
X    prior to submitting entries.  To obtain them, send Email to the address
X    above and use the subject 'send rules'.
X
X    One may obtain winners of previous contests (1984 to date), via ftp from:

X      programs ever.
X
X    Winners will receive the fame and attention that goes with having their
X    program entry posted as a winner to programmers world-wide.
X
X    The 1993 contest rules and results are available by ftp as
X    ``wilma.cs.brown.edu:pub/postscript/obfuscated*.shar'', or individually
X    in the obfuscated directory. The judges will post the 1994 rules
X    in November to comp.lang.postscript on Usenet, and other places.
X    Send questions to jgm@cs.brown.edu.
X
X    Categories include: Best Obfuscated PostScript, Best Artwork,
X    Most Compact, Best Interactive Program, Most Useful, and
X    anything so unusual and creative that it deserves an award.
X
X    The judges will choose the winners of each category.
X
X    Alena Lacova  is a system  administrator at NIKHEF  (Institute for High

I've been using the XmGraph widget that's been floating around and I
noticed the performance is significantly better using Gadgets, perhaps
even 100% faster.  I had heard in an old programming course that gadgets
were no longer any benefit to performance, and that it's just as well
to use widgets everywhere.  So why would ~50 pushbutton gadgets be a lot
quicker than 50 pushbuttons in the graph?  Should I start putting gadgets
back into my long pulldown menus? 

XmGraph manages children connected by XmArc widgets in a directed network
type graph with automatic layout capability.

No. This is only relevant for OpenWindows 3.x as shipped with SunOS.
It is not relevant for MIT R5. MIT R5 should compile without problems.

I have been building X11 with gcc since 2.1 and the only time I had
trouble was when the position independant code option broke (so I
couldn't use gcc to build Sun shared libraries). The important thing to
do is to follow the tips given in the gcc release. Gcc generates code
that requires libgcc2 and you should take that into account when
deciding which compiler to use for the libraries.

Hi,

I am about to write an application in X/Motif that will require the
embedding of a pseudo tty. So, before I re-invent the wheel, has anyone
written/gotten a motif widget that does the job ? Otherwise, I would
appreciate any pointers to make such a beast.

My environment is X11R4/Motif 1.1 and X11R5/Motif 1.2 (if this helps).


Thanks in advance.

I need to have PCs and SPARCstations run the same application ( namely
MicroSoft Project ). The original system ran on the PC. Now it needs to
be expanded to allow UNIX users to work with the application. The
current proposal is to use DESQview/X as a display server for the
application.

I would like to know your experiences with using DESQview/X to run an
application on a PC and displaying on a SPARCstation. I've heard that
the network traffic is slow.

Replies only by e-mail please.

Thanks, in advance.

It's my understanding that the next release of UIM/X, due out
last February :-) has full support for C++.

I use XDesigner which does not have the interpreter or UI meta languages
of these other tools but does fully support C++ code generation,
reusable templates via C++ classes which are generated, a variety of
other handy features for using C++ and layout functions in different
ways, and generates Motif 1.2 code (including drag 'n drop, 
internationalization, etc.).  Fits in quite nicely with Doug Young's
paradigm for C++/Motif.

Available in the US from VI Corp, in Europe from Imperial Software,
London (see FAQ for details).

You are right in supposing that the problem is with the XmNcolormap
(XtNcolormap for truly literate beings) not being set.  What you want
to do is start your application with your new colormap.  This can be a
chicken and egg sort of problem, however.  If you look at the Xt FAQ
there is an example that should show how it can be done.  If not, let
me know and maybe I can improve the example.

Hello,

does somebody know the functions  XtShellStrings and XtStrings?
I haven't found them in any librarys not Xm, Xt, nor X11, and I need
them to install a tool.

Any hints greatly appreciated! Please reply via e-mail.

Thanks in advance!

They aren't functions, they are character arrays. The standard strings
are either defined as string constants or character pointers into
XtShellStrings and XtStrings determined by XTSTRINGDEFINES. Your
libraries were compiled with this defined and your application with it
undefined so simply recompile one or the other. It is probably worth
adding -DXTSTRINGDEFINES to your CFLAGS.

I have a program produces a continuous tone by calling XBell
repeatedly at an interval equal to the duration of the bell. If it is
run more than once on a display, the tones are buffered in the X
server and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program
have exited. Is there a convenient way of preventing this, e.g., by
emptying the X server bell buffer when each program exits?

At Robert Gordon University, programming was the main (most time-consuming) 
start of the course. The first two years consisted of five subjects:
Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000 
assembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and 
Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group
discussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea).
The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company 
for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special 
Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).  
The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering 
(C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing 
Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where 
students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an 
outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change 
suddenly).
 
In the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and 
exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a 
30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework 
assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this?

BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by
Honours year. Also, every course is tutored separately. Not easy trying
to sleep when you are in 8 student class :-). 

Cheers,
  Michael

Subject:  87)  Where can I get an X-based troff previewer?

	X11R4 has two previewers for device-independent troff: the supported 
client xditview, and the contributed-but-well-maintained xtroff. An earlier 
version of xtroff also appeared on the R3 contributed source. xditview is also
in the R5 distribution.
	In addition, the xman client can be used to preview troff documents
which use the -man macros (i.e. man pages).
	If psroff is used its output can be viewed with a PostScript previewer.

In addition:

	xproof, an X previewer for ditroff has been contributed by Marvin 
Solomon (solomon@cs.wisc.edu); version 3.5 is available on export in 
contrib/xproof*. 	[8/90]

	Elan Computer Group (CA: 415-964-2200) produces eroff, a modified 
troff implementation, and Elan/Express, an X11 eroff previewer.

	SoftQuad (416-963-8337; USA only 800-387-2777, mail@sq.uu.net or
mail@sq.com) offers SoftQuad Publishing Software, including a substantially-
rewritten troff formatter, a better intermediate language with backwards 
compatibility, and an X11[R3,R4] previewer. (This is the package adopted by 
AT&T's own MIS department, and used in and re-sold by many parts of AT&T).

Subject:  88)! Where can I get a WYSIWYG interface builder?

	A new release of the DIRT interface builder by Richard Hesketh works 
with X11R5 and includes some support for the Motif widget set. From the README:
  This builder allows the interactive creation and rapid prototyping of X user
  interfaces using the X Toolkit and a number of Widget Sets.  Dirt generates
  "Wc - Widget Creation" resource files and this distribution also includes the
  Widget Creation Library (version 1.06, with the exception of the demos and
  Mri/Ari source code) with the kind permission of its author David E. Smyth.
Check dirt.README, dirt.A2.0.tar.Z, and dirt.PS.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.

	The InterViews 3.0.1 C++ toolkit contains a WYSIWIG interface builder 
called ibuild. ibuild generates code for an InterViews application complete 
with Imakefile and an X-resource file. Documentation is /pub/papers/ibuild.ps 
on interviews.stanford.edu (36.22.0.175).
	Quest Windows's (408-496-1900) ObjectViews C++ package includes an
interactive building tool. 

	Druid (Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development) runs on SPARC 
machines using OSF/Motif 1.0; it is intended eventually to be a full UIMS but 
apparently now has only support for creating the presentation components, for 
which it generates C/UIL code. Info: Singh G, Kok CH, Ngan TY, "Druid: A System
for Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development". Proc. ACM SIGGRAPH Symp 
on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST'90). ACM, NY, 1990, pp:167-177.

	The BYO interface builder is implemented in tcl.

	In addition, these commercial products (unsorted) are available in 
final or prerelease form [the * following the product name indicates that the 
product is known to allow the designer to specify for each widget whether a 
particular resource is hard-coded or written to an application defaults file,
for at least one form of output]. Some are much more than user-interface tools;

	In addition, Neuron Data (1 415 321-4488) makes Open Interface, a 
window-system-independent object toolkit which supports interfaces which are 
or resemble (supersets of) Mac, Windows, and Motif and Open Look; the package 
includes an interface builder.

       In addition, the GRAMMI builder supports the development of Ada/X 
applications using its own set of objects which are planned to have a Motif 
look.  GRAMMI is written in Ada and generates Ada specs and stub bodies. 
(1-800-GRAMMI-1).

	In addition, these non-WYSIWYG but related products may help for goals 
of rapid prototyping of the application interface:

	WCL: the Widget Creation Library. Basically describes the widget
hierarchy and actions in a resources file; available from fine archive servers
everywhere, including devvax.jpl.nasa.gov (128.149.1.143) in pub/. Wcl provides
a very thin layer over Xt without any internal tweaking. Version 2.5 is current
[3/93].
	WINTERP: an Xlisp-based Motif toolkit allows for interpretive 
programming. The copy on the R4 tape is outdated; get a copy off export or 
email to winterp-source%hplnpm@hplabs.hp.com. 
	The Serpent UIMS permits the building of user-interfaces without 
specific knowledge of coding but with an understanding of attributes being set
on a particular [Motif] widget.  Beta Release 1.2 is available from 
ftp.sei.cmu.edu (128.237.1.13) and can be found in /pub/serpent.  Serpent is 
also available on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.11) in /contrib/serpent. Email
questions can go to serpent@sei.cmu.edu. A commercial version of Serpent is
available as "Agora" from ASET, 221 Woodhaven Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15228.
	Garnet is a Common Lisp-based GUI toolkit. Information is available

Subject:  89)  Where can I find X tools callable from shell scripts?
I want to have a shell script pop up menus and yes/no dialog boxes if the user 
is running X.

	Several tools in the R3 contrib/ area were developed to satisfy these
needs: yorn pops up a yes/no box, xmessage displays a string, etc. There are
several versions of these tools; few, if any, have made it to the R4 contrib/ 
area, though they may still be available on various archive sites.
	In addition, Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has posted the xmenu
package to comp.sources.x ("v08i008: xmenu") for 1-of-n choices.  [7/90]
	Two versions of XPrompt have been posted to comp.sources.x, the latter
being an unauthorized rewrite. [R. Forsman (thoth@reef.cis.ufl.edu), 1/91]

being worked on and will likely be re-released.
	xp-1.1.tar.Z, xpick-1.0.tar.Z and xzap-1.0.tar.Z on export's contrib/
are tools by Gerry.Tomlinson@newcastle.ac.UK which act as X versions of the 
simple display and choice-making tools in K&P. [4/92]
	xtpanel lets the user build a panel containing interactive objects such
as buttons, sliders, text fields, etc., either from the command line or using a
simple scripting language. It is available for anonymous ftp from 
hanauma.Stanford.EDU (36.51.0.16) as pub/X/xtpanel.tar.Z and may also be found 
in the alt.sources archives.

Subject:  91)! How can I "tee" an X program identically to several displays?

	There are several protocol multiplexer tools which provide for the 
simultaneous display of X clients on any number of machines.
	XMX (an X Protocol Multiplexor) is available from wilma.cs.brown.edu 
(128.148.33.66) as pub/xmx.tar.Z It works independently of the server and does

Subject:  92)  TOPIC: BUILDING THE X DISTRIBUTION [topic needs updating to R5]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  93)  What's a good source of information on configuring the X build?

	This FAQ includes information on a number of "gotchas" that can bite 
you on particular system. However, the best source of general information on 
building the X11 release is found in the Release Notes. The file is bundled 
separately from the rest of the release, so if it's become separated from your 
sources you can FTP another copy separately: the file RELNOTES.[ms,PS,TXT] at 
the top of the distribution. The file RELNOTES is also available from the 
xstuff mail server.
	In addition, O'Reilly & Associates's Volume 8 on X Administration
includes information on configuring and building X.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  94)  Why doesn't my Sun with a cg6 work with R5?

	Apparently gcc is the problem; it seems to produce fine code for all
Sun displays except for the cgsix. The new sunGX.o distributed with fix-07 
may fix the problem (note: not known to work on Solaris).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  95)  Why doesn't my Sun with SunOS 4.1 know about _dlsym, etc.?

	If you get errors with _dlsym _dlopen _dlclose undefined, link with 
libdl.a.  Add "-ldl" to your and eventually your site.def.  You may want to 
surround it with "-Bstatic -ldl -Bdynamic" if you add it to the EXTRA_LIBRARIES
variable, since "syslibs" get added after EXTRA_LIBRARIES on the eventual 
compilation command; otherwise you may not have a shared libdl.  (Or compile 
the stubs shared.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  96)  What is this strange problem building X clients on SunOS 4.1.2?

	In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts
with the way X11R4 builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols to be
undefined when building some X11 clients: 
	_get_wmShellWidgetClass
	_get_applicationShellWidgetClass
Compiling "-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic" appears to work. 

To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please 
contact your local Sun office and request the following patches:

Patch i.d.      Description
100512-02       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch

                        shared libXmu

[Greg Earle, earle@Sun.COM; 7/92] 

A source patch for use with the MIT X11R4 libraries was developed by Conrad 
Kimball (cek@sdc.boeing.com); it retrofits into R4 some fixes made in R5 to
get around this problem. The patch is on export in [1/93]
	contrib/X11R4_sunos4.1.2_patch_version3.Z

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  97)  Why can't gcc compile X11R4 on my SPARC?
I used gcc to compile the whole distribution, but I get several segmentation
faults when running X.

	Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in
any performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the
680x0 or VAX platforms.

	Here is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing 
structures as arguments and returning them as function values, so when 
gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or 
return structs, run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and 
the server.

	This is from the GCC manual:

	On the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for 
	structures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument
	list, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by 
	reference.

	This really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet
	supported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.

	The convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and
	`-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.

You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just
the routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with 
compilation flags.  

	Files which need to be compiled using cc include:
		server/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c 
		rgb/rgb.c

	In addition, several of the "inet_" functions use structs as args or
return values:  
		clients/xhost/xhost.c 
		clients/xauth/gethost.c. 
Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly 
harmless as they don't involve structs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  98)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?
When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error 
	"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. 
	Fatal server bug! no screens found."

	Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do 
this simple test:

	#include <sys/ioctl.h>
	SIOCGIFCONF

Run that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of 
interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like 
whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your 
fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc
sources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are 
identical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make 
sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  99)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 on the older Sun3?
In mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found "missing" defines for 
CG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be?

	The R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add
these lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:
        #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)
        #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN
        #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN
        #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN

	However, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so 
references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the 
Imakefile.  [11/90]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 100)  What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS 4.1.1?
The file <sundev/cg6reg.h> isn't being found.

	Sun omitted <sundev/cg6reg.h> from SunOS 4.1.1. Remove the #include 
from sunCG6C.c and replace it with the line 
	#define CG6_VADDR_COLOR   0x70016000
The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied 
from another distribution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 101)  What are these problems using R4 shared libraries on SunOS 4?
All of the executables that I try to run have the following results:
	ld.so: libXmu.so.4: not found
or even:
	ld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96c

	If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun, remember that you 
need to run "ldconfig" as root after installing the shared libraries (if you've
installed X on a file-server, run it on the server's clients, too).  While 
building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid 
linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those 
distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.  
If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that 
the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or 
/usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked 
statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]
	Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it
attempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.
You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to
most C compilers).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)

This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in 
X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was 
removed in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5
libraries only applied to the documented interface).  

A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4
or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.

[10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis 
(jpf@heliocentric.com)]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?

	There is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload)
running under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using 
shared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:
	1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system
administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used
by these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security 
problems at your site.
	2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).
	3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths
to the libraries.

[from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]

The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the
newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid
program from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this 
may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. 
Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?

	On many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits 
anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by 
accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps
more annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 106)  What is Imake?

	Imake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is a
makefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro-
processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles 
suitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not 
specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the 
configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.
	Imake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by
which the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration
files, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not 
obvious.
	There have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and
R5 versions are different.

	You can obtain information on imake from these sources:
	- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on
using Imake to build X
	- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information
	- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4
guide to imake.
	- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim
Fulton on an early version of Imake
	- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful 
explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-
supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu
in the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and 
config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. 
[7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email;
mail a message body of "send imake-stuff help" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.
	- see "System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?" by Dinah McNutt
in the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.
	- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article "Das Meta-Make 
/ I make, you make / Schwerelos" by Rainer Klute in "iX 
Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin", directed at application programmers needing to
write Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The
X Journal, issue 2:1.
	- The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on
demystifying Imake.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 107)  Where can I get imake?

	Versions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier 
version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits 
redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the 
template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such 
configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the 
templates distributed with X11R5.
	export contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake
without picking up the entire distribution.
	A stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in
ftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?

	If you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run "xmkmf". This is a 
script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a 
Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, 
which will use that new Makefile to compile the program.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines?
When I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:
	Undefined:
	_XShapeQueryExtension
	_XShapeCombineMask

	These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE)
which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular
windows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will 
only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many 
vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case 
they will display rectangular windows anyway.

	In order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library 
libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes
will be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do 
not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be 
compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can
probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X 
libraries.

Subject: 110)  What are these problems with "_XtInherit not found" on the Sun?
When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the 
error "ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit".

	What you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to 
get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that 
is both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting 
_XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby 
guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where 
XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally
be called.

	You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal
Xt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. 
	1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a 
connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called
XtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your 
program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.
	2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is
correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView 
program. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command. 

	It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,
although this will certainly solve the problem.

Subject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X?
I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under 
the current version of X, I get this message:
	Undefined:
	_XtScrollBarSetThumb
	_XtTextSetInsertionPoint
	_XtTextReplace

	There were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition
to the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4
release notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but
are part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?

	The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one
window to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the
window manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are
called "hints" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you
can use something like the following:

        XWMHints wmhints;
        ...
        wmhints.flags = InputHint;
        wmhints.input = True;
        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)

If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput 
resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have
source, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.

Certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having 
this done. 

	If you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource
to your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.
	OpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true

[mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?

	You can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be
spoofed in any case. 
	For most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so 
long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in 
which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for
particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can 
sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may 
be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take
advantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order
to give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window 
manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;
this surely leads to future compatibility problems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?
	
	There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the 
Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development 
under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional 
development. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive 
application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good
applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to "test just 
this one little thing" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that 
puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for
quick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 
distributions, and the Xlib "Hello World" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and 
R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 
Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x  
by Glenn Widener of Tektronix. 	[3/90]

	In addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute 
showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display 
connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?

	The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is
sensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:
	{
	Arg args[3];
	int i;
	int sensitive;		/* oops; wrong data type */
	i=0;
	XtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;
	XtGetValues(widget, args, i );
	...
	}

But XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; 
declaring the variable "sensitive" as Boolean works properly. This problem 
comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types 
Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar 
problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you
use the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page.
[11/90]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?

	You're probably trying to use these functions from application code.
They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a 
parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising 
functions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use 
only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.
	The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a
widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.
Although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your
application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the 
widgets' data becoming corrupted.
	[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be 
avoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?

	Although there are various details of the current implementation of
the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no
such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for
the "new" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location
in the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves?
What should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics are
defined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old 
widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired 
resources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in 
creating a new widget.

	Note that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.

Window placement on screen
--------------------------

I would like to configure my system (a HP UNIX) to avoid that any corner
of a given window is displayed outside of the visible screen. The whole
window should be visible and it should be impossible to move any window
outside the visible aerea.

1. Can this be done by configuring the window manager's resources

2. Can this be done on applikation level 

3. A hardcoded solution is possible, but is it possible to have a
  upper limit of a given window size

Subject: 119)  I'm writing a widget and can't use a float as a resource value.

Float resources are not portable; the size of the value may be larger than
the size of an XtPointer. Try using a pointer to a float instead; the Xaw
Scrollbar float resources are handled in this way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 121)  Are callbacks guaranteed to be called in the order registered?

	Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xt
happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered, 
the specification does not guarantee such a sequence, and supplemental 
authoritative documents (i.e. the Asente/Swick volume) do say that the order is
undefined.  Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and
the application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.
	In general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating 
independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other
callbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be 
registered can explicitly call other functions necessary.

[4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?

	XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving
dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not 
actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?
	
	It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback,
which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer
is set to one of the valid values. If it is not a "yes" answer, the code drops
out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: 

	void quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)
	{
		int             answer;
		answer = AskUser(w, "Really Quit?");
		if (RET_YES == answer)
			{
			answer = AskUser(w, "Are You Really Positive?");
			if (RET_YES == answer)
				exit(0);
                }
	}

	A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether 
to overwrite it.
	This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and
waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the
calling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the 
Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of 
dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for "OK", "Cancel" and 
"Help" or equivalents:

  int AskUser(w, string)
        Widget          w;
        char           *string;
  {
        int             answer=RET_NONE;	/* some not-used marker */
        Widget          dialog;			/* could cache&carry, but ...*/
        Arg             args[3];
        int             n = 0;
        XtAppContext    context;

        n=0;
        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,
                XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;
        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;
        dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);
        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);
        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);
        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);
        XtManageChild(dialog);

        context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);
        while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {
                XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);
        }
        XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */
        return answer;
  }

	The dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same 
function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user 
finally selects one of those choices:

  void response(w, client, call)
        Widget          w;
        XtPointer client;
        XtPointer call;
  {
  int *answer = (int *) client;
  XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;
        switch (reason->reason) {
        case XmCR_OK:
                *answer = RET_YES;	/* some #define value */
                break;
        case XmCR_CANCEL:
                *answer = RET_NO; 
		break;
        case XmCR_HELP:
                *answer = RET_HELP;
                break;
        default:
                return;
        }
}

and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and
continues from there.

Subject: 124)  How do I determine the name of an existing widget?
I have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is.

	Users of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function, which 
will work on both widgets and non-widget objects.

	If you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do 
what you want. Note that it depends on the widget's internal data structures 
and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt, including R4.

	#include <X11/CoreP.h>
	#include <X11/Xresource.h>
	String XtName (widget)
	Widget widget;	/* WILL work with non-widget objects */
	{
	return XrmNameToString(widget->core.xrm_name);
	}

Subject: 125)  Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindow(widget)?
I'm doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics
within my Xt-based program:

> canvas = XtCreateManagedWidget ( ...,widgetClass,...) /* drawing area */
> ...
> window = XtWindow(canvas);	/* get the window associated with the widget */
> ...
> XDrawLine (...,window,...);	/* produces error */

	The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the 
realization of the widget.  Using a window id of NULL ("no window") could 
create the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() 
before attempting to use the window associated with a widget. 
	Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call, 
but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also 
wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?

The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of 
the screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can take
the following steps to avoid the error:

1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture.
2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle.
3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap.
4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the
image from the pixmap.
5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and 
the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you 
the parts of the pixmap which aren't good.
6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.

Subject: 127)  How can my application tell if it is being run under X?

	A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight
character-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is
running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:
	
	display = XOpenDisplay(display_name);
	if (display)
		{ do X stuff }
	else
		{ do curses or something else }
where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following
-display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case 
XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].

This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line 
argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is 
adequate. [5/91]

Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?

	The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is 
as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel 
window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other 
application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the 
user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual 
desktop.) Substitute "toplevel" with your top-most widget here (similar code 
should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):

     unsigned long valuemask;
     XSetWindowAttributes attributes;

     /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */
     valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;
     attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |
         ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);
     attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);

     /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by
        its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */
     XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,
         65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,
         CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);

where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen,
particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than
32767.

When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to
normal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse
events; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not
have a similar effect on keystrokes as well.

In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor 
resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the
cursor without blocking pointer events.

Subject: 129)  How do I fork without hanging my parent X program?

	An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which 
continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its 
children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X 
connection to the display. 
	What you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, 
		close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget)));
to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your 
exec. You will then be able to exit the parent.
	Alternatively, before exec'ing make this call, which causes the file 
descriptor to be closed on exec.
		(void) fcntl(ConnectionNumber(XDisplay), F_SETFD, 1);

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 130)  Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler?

	No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical 
sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which 
might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave
the library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points
out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls
any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to
Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be
called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by 
Xlib or Xt functions.
	You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt
handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which
has previously been added.

	Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly 
Volume 6 are in error.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 131)  What are these "Xlib sequence lost" errors?

	You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error 
handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or 
Xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?

	It's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input 
both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but 
which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or 
the other file descriptor.
	A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor,
use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be 
called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your 
program's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt 
callback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only
non-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.
	Most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an 
input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.
	Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file.
You will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending.
XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is 
called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is
new data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always 
ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning
and read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almost
always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the 
type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your 
function to test whether there is new data:
	     if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return;
But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a 
busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting 
a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.

Subject: 133)  How do I simulate a button press/release event for a widget?

	You can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting
the window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget
which should receive the event.
	 If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use 
XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you
avoid a round-trip to the server.
	Depending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call
its action procedures in order to get the effects you want.

Subject: 134)  Why doesn't anything appear when I run this simple program?

> ...
> the_window = XCreateSimpleWindow(the_display,
>      root_window,size_hints.x,size_hints.y,
>      size_hints.width,size_hints.height,BORDER_WIDTH,

> XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);
> ...

	You are right to map the window before drawing into it. However, the 
window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen --
until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will 
generally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code 
would appear after window was created and mapped:
  while (!done)
    {
      XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);
      switch (the_event.type) {
	case Expose:	 /* On expose events, redraw */
		XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);
		break;
	...
	}
    }

	Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't 
set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background 
colors, so this program could previously include this code:
  ...
  the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen);	/* e.g. */
  the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen);	/* e.g. */
  the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,
                GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);
  ...
 
Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is 
black and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 
and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be 
reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.

Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong 
thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for 
foreground and background.

And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program
if you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may
not yet have appeared.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?

	The 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about
one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A 
server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0,
unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit --
the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available 
Screens on this particular Display connection.
	The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular
Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one
which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.
	In Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine 
the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.
	(Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros
which return characteristics of the Screen have "Display" in the names -- 
XDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)

Subject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11? Motif? XView?
	
	The X11R4/5 header files are compatible with C++. The Motif 1.1 header 
files are usable as is inside extern "C" {...}. However, the definition of
String in Intrinsic.h can conflict with the libg++ or other String class and
needs to be worked around.

	Some other projects which can help:
	WWL, a set of C++ classes by Jean-Daniel Fekete to wrap X Toolkit 
widgets, available via anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu as 
contrib/WWL-1.2.tar.Z [7/92] or lri.lri.fr (129.175.15.1) as pub/WWL-1.2.tar.Z.
It works by building a set of C++ classes in parallel to the class tree of the 
widgets.
	The C++ InterViews toolkit is obtainable via anonymous FTP from 
interviews.stanford.edu. InterViews uses a box/glue model similar to that of 
TeX for constructing user interfaces and supports multiple looks on the user 
interfaces. Some of its sample applications include a WYSIWIG document editor 
(doc), a MacDraw-like drawing program (idraw) and an interface builder 
(ibuild).
	THINGS,  a class library written at the Rome Air Force Base by the 
Strategic Air Command, available as freeware on archive sites.

	Motif++ is a public-domain library that defines C++ class wrappers for
Motif 1.1; it adds an "application" class for, e.g., initializing X, and also
integrates WCL and the Xbae widget set. This work was developed by Ronald van 
Loon <rvloon@cv.ruu.nl> based on X++, a set of bindings done by the University 
of Lowell Graphics Research Laboratory. The current sources are available from 
decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1) as /pub/X11/motif++.21.jul.92.tar.Z.
	
	The source code examples for Doug Young's "Object-Oriented Programming 
with C++ and OSF/Motif" [ISBN 0-13-630252-1] do not include "widget wrappers" 
but do include a set of classes that encapsulates higher-level facilities 
commonly needed by Motif- or other Xt-based applications; check export in
~ftp/contrib/young.c++.tar.Z.
	Rogue Wave offers "View.h++" for C++ programmers using Motif; info:
1-800-487-3217 or +1 503 754 2311.
	A product called "Commonview" by Glockenspiel Ltd, Ireland (??) 
apparently is a C++-based toolkit for multiple window systems, including PM,
Windows, and X/Motif.
	Xv++ is sold by Qualix (415-572-0200; fax -1300); it implements an 
interface from the GIL files that Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0 
produces to Xview wrapper classes in C++.

	UIT is a set of C++ classes embedding the XView toolkit; it is intended
for use with Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0 builder tool. Sources are 
on export.mit.edu.au as UIT.tar.Z. Version 2 was released 5/28/92.
	
	Also of likely use is ObjectCenter (Saber-C++). And a reasonable
alternative to all of the above is ParcPlace's (formerly Solbourne's) Object 
Interface.

	There is an X/Ada study team sponsored by NASA JSC, which apparently is
working out bindings. Information: xada@ghg.hou.tx.us.
	GNU SmallTalk has a beta native SmallTalk binding to X called STIX (by
Steven.Byrne@Eng.Sun.COM). It is still in its beginning stages, and 
documentation is sparse outside the SmallTalk code itself. The sources are 
available as /pub/gnu/smalltalk-1.1.1.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu (18.71.0.38) or 
ugle.unit.no (129.241.1.97).
	Prolog bindings (called "XWIP") written by Ted Kim at UCLA while
supported in part by DARPA are available by anonymous FTP from
export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwip.tar.Z or ftp.cs.ucla.edu:pub/xwip.tar.Z.
These prolog language bindings depend on having a Quintus-type foreign function
interface in your prolog. The developer has gotten it to work with Quintus and 
SICStus prolog. Inquiries should go to xwip@cs.ucla.edu. [3/90]
	Scheme bindings to Xlib, OSF/Motif, and Xaw are part of the Elk

Subject: 138)  Can XGetWindowAttributes get a window's background pixel/pixmap?

	No.  Once set, the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be 
re-read by clients.  The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap,
set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The 
window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're 
sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea() 
to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read 
back that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and 
it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD 
and Stuart Marks of Sun]

	Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a 
(mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the
pixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the 
original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved.

Subject: 139)  How do I create a transparent window?
	
	A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly
window. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have
several choices:
	- the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to
make non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the
areas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers 
support the extension.
	- a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for
particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note 
that there is no X notion of a "transparent color index".
	- a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny 
windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.
	- a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent
window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application
window with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors
that will appear properly.

Subject: 140)  Why doesn't GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values?

	When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a
background of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing
operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that
the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually
random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black
and White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical
coincidence will break.]
	If you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be 
allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen
pre-computed values.
	If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you 
can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics 
context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over 
red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. 
This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and 
blue.

Subject: 141)  Why does every color I allocate show up as black?

	Make sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red, green, and blue 
fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is 
full-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color) 
the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is 
usually black.

Subject: 143)  Why does the pixmap I copy to the screen show up as garbage? 

	The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most
servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there 
-- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using
XFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever 
color you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a 
mask). [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]

Subject: 144)  How do I check whether a window ID is valid?
My program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether
the window exists before doing anything with it.

	Because X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window 
would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an
event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the
event without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow 
errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will
work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed 
and its ID reallocated to another window.

[courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?

	Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually,
the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that 
knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except
for GCs and private color cells, can be shared].
	The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple 
applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the
applications' running on different machines) is in the first application to 
create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into
it. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also
knows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.
	[Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first
application running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned
in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]
	Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level 
cooperation among your applications. 
	Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to 
use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it 
should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.

Subject: 146)  Why can't my program work with tvtwm or swm?

	A number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not
handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return 
the wrong child of root. A general solution is to add this code or to use it in
your own application where you would normally use RootWindow(dpy,screen):

/* Function Name: GetVRoot
 * Description: Gets the root window, even if it's a virtual root
 * Arguments: the display and the screen
 * Returns: the root window for the client
 */
#include <X11/Xatom.h>
Window GetVRoot(dpy, scr)
Display        *dpy;
int             scr;
{
Window          rootReturn, parentReturn, *children;
unsigned int    numChildren;
Window          root = RootWindow(dpy, scr);
Atom            __SWM_VROOT = None;
int             i;

  __SWM_VROOT = XInternAtom(dpy, "__SWM_VROOT", False);
  XQueryTree(dpy, root, &rootReturn, &parentReturn, &children, &numChildren);
  for (i = 0; i < numChildren; i++) {
	Atom            actual_type;
	int             actual_format;
	long            nitems, bytesafter;
	Window         *newRoot = NULL;

	if (XGetWindowProperty(dpy, children[i], __SWM_VROOT, 0, 1,
	    False, XA_WINDOW, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems,
            &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newRoot) == Success && newRoot) {
			root = *newRoot;
			break;

Subject: 147)  How do I keep a window from being resized by the user?

	Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers
can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but 
there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. You can try setting 
the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best. 
[1/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 148)  How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times?

	It's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself
[e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped -- 
imagine the conflict between two such programs running.  
	The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack
is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily
assuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do 
this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup 
menus or other short parameter-setting windows).

with the colormap and changing the color of the contents.

Subject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib?

	Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help 
get notification of double-clicking.
	There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the 
protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do 
client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer
actually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you 
have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish 
implementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of 
the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.
	Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click
be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case
in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise
check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should
be the single-click action or the double-click action.

Subject: 151)! How do I render rotated text?
	
	Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics 
capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics
libraries.
	Your only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to
render the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it "by 
hand" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via 
XPutImage(); more specifically:
	1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.
	2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).
	3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.
	4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where 
		a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)
		b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)
	5) render I2
	Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose
bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.
	The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X 
also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS,
although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the
same fonts that would be found on a printer.
	In addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font
on it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some
predefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each
glyph.

(etaylor@wilkins.bmc.tmc.edu), and Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 11/90;
Liam Quin (lee@sq.com), 12/90]

	InterViews (C++ UI toolkit, in the X contrib software) has support for
rendering rotated fonts in X.  It could be one source of example code.
[Brian R. Smith (brsmith@cs.umn.edu), 3/91]
	Another possibility is to use the Hershey Fonts; they are 
stroke-rendered and can be used by X by converting them into XDrawLine 
requests. [eric@pencom.com, 10/91]

	The xrotfont program by Alan Richardson (mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk) 
(posted to comp.sources.x July 14 1992) paints a rotated font by implementing 
the method above and by using an outline (Hershey) font.
	The xvertext package by Alan Richardson (mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk) is a 
set of functions to facilitate the writing of text at any angle.  Version 3.0 
was recently released to alt.sources and comp.sources.misc [3/93]; it is also 
on export as contrib/xvertext.3.0.shar.Z. 

	O'Reilly's X Resource Volume 3 includes information from HP about
modifications to the X fonts server which provide for rotated and scaled text.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 152)  What is the X Registry? (How do I reserve names?)

	There are places in the X Toolkit, in applications, and in the X
protocol that define and use string names. The context is such that conflicts
are possible if different components use the same name for different things.
	The MIT X Consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains:
orgainization names, selection names, selection targets, resource types,
application classes, and class extension record types; and several others.
	The list as of 7/91 is in the directory mit/doc/Registry on the R5 
tape; it is also available by sending "send docs registry" to the xstuff mail
server.
	To register names (first come, first served) or to ask questions send 
to xregistry@expo.lcs.mit.edu; be sure to include a postal address for
confirmation.

There is no event mask for a particular mouse button press. However in your
event handler you can use the event structure passed in and query it to find
which button was pressed i.e.

void
SomeEventHandler(Widget w, XtPointer data, XEvent *event)
{
    /* Catch the button 1 (usually left button) */
    if ( event->xbutton.button == Button1 ) {
        /* do some action */
    } else {
        /* do nothing and exit from function */
    } 
}

You wanna do masking. Build a bitmap (pixmap of depth one) where all pixels
you name "opaque" are 1 (that get copied) and the others are 0. Use this
bitmap as the clip_mask in the gc used for XCopyArea(), and remember to
adjust the clip_origin coordinates to the XCopyArea() blit origin.

The Mouse pointer (besides from that it is driven using RAMDAC analog
mapping on most hardwares) uses a mask, too.

But be warned: blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask
is annoying slow on most xservers... it flickers even at 40 MIPS...

No. As soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a
little dislocation, you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the
icon first blitted, because it draws a full rectangle. The way to do it
is masking: Create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are 1 and all
not to be merged are 0. Then, set the clip_mask of the gc to this
bitmap, set the clip_x_origin and clip_y_origin of the gc to the x/y
coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable, use GXCopy,
and XCopyArea() the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   1)! What books and articles on X are good for beginners?

	Ken Lee of SynOptics (klee@synoptics.com) regularly posts to 
comp.windows.x and ba.windows.x a bibliography containing cites of all known 
reference books and how-to manuals and also cites of selected technical 
articles on X and X programming; it is ftp-able as 
	export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xbibliography and 
	gatekeeper.dec.com:/pub/X11/contrib/Xbibliography

Here is an unordered set of the reference books and tutorials most useful for
beginners; most appear on that list [comments are gathered from a variety of 
places and are unattributable]:

Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., "X Window System Toolkit, The Complete
Programmer's Guide and Specification", Digital Press, 1990.  The bible on Xt. A
treasury of information, excellent and invaluable.  Distributed by Digital 
Press, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by Prentice-Hall, 
ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL. 
[The examples are on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/ and on gatekeeper.dec.com 
(16.1.0.2) in pub/X11/contrib as asente-swick.examples.tar.Z.  They were also 
posted to comp.sources.x as xt-examples/part0[1-5].]

Jones, Oliver, Introduction to the X Window System, Prentice-Hall, 1988, 1989.
ISBN 0-13-499997-5. An excellent introduction to programming with Xlib.  
Written with the programmer in mind, this book includes many practical tips 
that are not found anywhere else. This book is not as broad as the O'Reilly 
Xlib tutorial, but Jones is an experienced X programmer and this shows in the 
quality and depth of the material in the book. Originally written for X11R1, 
recent printings have included corrections and additions and current material.
 
Young, Doug. "The X Window System: Applications and Programming with Xt (Motif 
Version)," Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8). The excellent tutorial 
"X Window System Programming and Applications with Xt," (ISBN 0-13-972167-3) 
updated for Motif. [The examples are available on export; the ones from the 
Motif version are in ~ftp/contrib/young.motif.tar.Z.]

Young, Doug and John Pew, "The X Window System: Programming and Applications 
with Xt, OPEN LOOK Edition" (ISBN 0-13-982992-X). The tutorial rewritten for 
OLIT, with new examples and drag/drop information. [Examples are on export in
youg.olit.tar.Z and in you OpenWindows 3 distribution in 
$OPENWINHOME/share/src/olit/olitbook.]

Heller, Dan. "Motif Programmers Manual". The 6th Volume in the O'Reilly series
covers Motif application programming; it's full of good examples. With Motif
reference pages. (ISBN 0-9937175-70-6.)  [The examples are available on uunet

Window System: The Complete Reference to Xlib, X Protocol, ICCCM, XLFD, X 
Version 11, Release 5, Third Edition," Digital Press, 1992. "The Bible" in its 
latest revision, an enhanced version of X documentation by the authors of the 
Xlib documentation. This is the most complete published description of the X 
programming interface and X protocol. It is the primary reference work and is 
not introductory tutorial documentation; additional tutorial works will usually
be needed by most new X programmers.  Digital Press order EY-J802E-DP, ISBN 
0-13-971201-1.
 	
Nye, Adrian, "Xlib Programming Manual, Volume 1" and "Xlib Reference Manual,

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   4)  What X-related public mailing lists are available?

	The xpert mailing list is the general, public mailing list on X
maintained by the X Consortium. The mailings are gatewayed, so xpert is almost 
identical to the comp.windows.x Usenet newsgroup. 

	***	If you get comp.windows.x, you don't need to 	***
	***	be added to the xpert mailing list. 		***

	Otherwise, you can join the list to receive X information 
electronically. It is best to find a local distribution; perhaps someone within
your company is already receiving the mailing. As a last resort, send mail to 
xpert-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with a valid return electronic address. 

	The xannounce mailing list carries major X announcements, such as new
releases (including public patches from MIT), public reviews, adoption of 
standards by the MIT X Consortium, and conference announcements.  It does NOT 
carry advertisements, source code, patches, or questions.  If you already 
receive the Usenet news group comp.windows.x.announce or the xpert mailing 
list, you don't need to be added to the xannounce mailing list.  Otherwise, to 
subscribe, send a request to xannounce-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu. Note: Only 
redistribution addresses will be accepted for this list -- i.e. no personal 
addresses. If you wish to receive xannounce yourself, please contact your mail 
administrator to set up a local redistribution list and to put you on it.  
	comp.windows.x.apps is not gatewayed to a mailing list.

	In addition, the X Consortium sponsors these public lists:
		bug-clx         CLX bug reports and discussions
		x-ada           X and ada
		x11-3d          people interested in X and 3d graphics
		ximage          people interested in image processing and X
		xvideo          discussion of video extensions for X
	To subscribe to one of these lists, assuming no-one in your 
organization already receives it, send mail to <list>-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu
with the Subject line including the name of the LIST in caps and the request
"addition request".  In the body of the message be sure to give an address for 
your local distribution which is accessible from MIT (eddie.mit.edu).

	A mailing list for topics related to OPEN LOOK is sponsored by Greg
Pasquariello of Unify corporation; send to openlook-request@unify.com (or
openlook-request%unify@uunet.uu.net) for information.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   7)  How do I ask a net-question so as to maximize helpful responses?

	When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists, be sure to include 
all information about your setup and what you are doing.  The more specific you
are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without
all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are
able to respond at all.

	Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it 
from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system,
give details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S 
version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to 
mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.

	Then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what
you expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the 
exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote 
doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary 
(just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?

	The trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.)
are publishing more articles on X.  Two X-specific publications include:

	- O'Reilly and Associates publishes "The X Resource: A Practical 
Journal of the X Window System" (103 Morris St. #A, Sebastapol, CA 95472).  
Editorial information: Adrian Nye, adrian@ora.com.

	- The X Journal is started bi-monthly publication September 1991 on a 
variety of X topics. Subscription information: The X Journal, Subscriber 
Services, Dept XXX, P.O. Box 3000, Denville, NJ 07834, USA. Editorial 
information: editors%topgun@uunet.uu.net.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   9)  What are these common abbreviations/acronyms?

	Xt: The X Toolkit Intrinsics is a library layered on Xlib which 
provides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. An "Xt-based" 
program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses 
Intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets.
	Xmu: The Xmu library is a collection of Miscellaneous Utility functions
useful in building various applications and widgets.
	Xaw: The Athena Widget Set is the MIT-implemented sample widget set
distributed with X11 source.
	Xm: The OSF/Motif widget set from the Open Software Foundation; binary
kits are available from many hardware vendors.
	Xhp (Xw): The Hewlett-Packard Widget Set was originally based on R2++, 
but several sets of patches exist which bring it up to R3, as it is distributed
on the X11R4 tapes. Supplemental patches are available to use it with R4/R5.
	CLX: The Common Lisp X Interface is a Common Lisp equivalent to Xlib.
	XDMCP: The X Display Manager Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for 
a display such as an X terminal to request login service from a remote host.
	XLFD: The X Logical Font Description Conventions describes a standard
logical font description and conventions to be used by clients so that they
can query and access those resources.
	RTFM: Common expert-speak meaning "please locate and consult the 
relevant documentation -- Read the Forgotten Manual".
	UTSL: A common expression meaning "take advantage of the fact that you 
aren't limited by a binary license -- Use The Source, Luke".
	API: Application-Programmer Interface. The function calls, etc., in
a programming library.
	BDF: Bitmap Distribution Format; a human-readable format for uncompiled
X fonts.
	GUI: graphical user interface.
	UIL: the User Interface Language, part of OSF/Motif which lets 
programmers specify a widget hierarchy in a simple "outline" form
	WCL: the Widget Creation Language, a package which extends the 
understanding of the Xt resource format such that a widget hierarchy and 
actions on the widgets can be specified through the resources file
	GIL: the file format put out by Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0
	UIMS: User Interface Management System

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  10)  What is the ICCCM? (How do I write X-friendly applications?)

	The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the 
official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It 
describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with 
other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need 
to read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the 
selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window 
manager.  Get it either:
	- as part of the R4 distribution from MIT
	- in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys "X Window System" book
	- as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, "X Protocol
Reference Manual." A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.
	The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to 
the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the 
presentation.

[from David Rosenthal, 10/90]

	- the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's
"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5". The complete document is on the R5
tapes.

	Alternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in "RTFM" and is
the most-important of the least-read X documents.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?

	The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the
development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of 
cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software 
interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.
	MIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and 
administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the 
Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership, 
Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).
	Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail, 
with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape,
interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.  
Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with 
others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification
is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium
as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public 
review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.
	Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or 
Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.
	Write to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer 
Science, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.

distribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?

	OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK
was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was
developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF 
members. 

	OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; 
there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications.
Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the 
one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce 
programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's 
(formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a "virtual toolkit" which provides objects in the
style of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.

	OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising 
their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.

[Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?

	Open Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system 
that combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface 
specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including
the SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and
a number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).

Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?

	DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI 
toolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a 
session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar, 
dxpsview, etc.).

(At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.)

Subject:  15)  What is PEX?

	PEX is the "PHiGS Extension to X".
	PHiGS stands for "Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics 
System" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation 
and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in 
hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension 
allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized 
hardware for 3D graphics.
	Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely 
redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample
implementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release.
Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for 
their workstations and X terminals.

Subject:  16)  What is "low-bandwidth X" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?

There are several options for using X over serial lines:

SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP
packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years,
and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations.
Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really 
ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per 
packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully 
so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). 

CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the 
40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do 
anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help,
but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed 
data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).

PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point
links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than
SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial 
line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for 
running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire
still needs compression somewhere to make it usable.

XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally
developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition 
to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes 
redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and 
using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a 
pseudo-X server or "proxy" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There 
are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:
   (1)	You don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't 
	otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly 
	connected), and
   (2)	It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that
	have to cross the serial interface, and
   (3)	In addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering 
	packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for 
	blocks to compress.

LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a
standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using 
NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX
will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information 
(e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, 
etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a 
Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample 
implementation available in R6.

Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how
LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu

Subject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?

	The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the
X window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is
no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways 
for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,
decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order
(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):

	wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3
	uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, 
although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.
	twm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window 
managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a
re-parenting window manager. 
	awm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers
some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers
	cwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. 
	rtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap
and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.
	dxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering
	hpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm
	mwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit
	tekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering 
	olwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style
Guide functionality
	olwm (AT&T): ditto
	gwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in
Lisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on
avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]
	m_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape
	pswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release
	swm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple
GUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes
from the resources file
	twm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked
twm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape
	vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a
single-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available
on archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available 
from export. [3/92]
	tvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm
and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is
available on archive servers
	olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is 
available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.
	mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version
is floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a 
source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].
	NCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look 
	XDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals 
	ctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 
twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export.
Version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.
	vuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.
	4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM
	piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?

	It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your 
window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X 
session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your 
window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in
the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:
		exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic
or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.
Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, 
whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?

	Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature --
which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the
geometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something 
close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are 
looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. 
Look for the application "xplaces" on an archive-server near you. There are 
several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage.
[10/90]
	Some new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the 
saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running
applications and the resource database. 
[Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?

	DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this, 
add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:
	sm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?

	You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using "xset r on|off". The X
protocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is
a capability not supported by all systems.
	Some servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide
command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over 
server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the 
server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server 
from MIT with the options "-ar1 350 -ar2 30" to reduce the sensitivity of the 
keyboard.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?

	There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be
produced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful 
for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and 
does not do "macro expansion."
	Some (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, 
accept a translation resource such as:
	xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \
		<Key>F1: string("setenv DISPLAY unix:0")
which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally
within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control
characters in the string, use \nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the
control character you want to include.
	Window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor
has a special "remapper" client been made available.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  24)! How do I make a screendump or print my application?

	The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window 
or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. 
The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr 
client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:
		csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &
and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current
display will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an
undocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the 
command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for 
specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]

	Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of 
arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.
There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92]
is the most recent.
	xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders 
XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr;
see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.
	A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr
is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: 
soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.
	xprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available
from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.

	To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr,
which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps
and XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for 
use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and
contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive
servers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.

	The XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and
save it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.

	Also: 

	Bristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter 
2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net
in vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.

	ColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen-
capture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and 
non-PostScript printers.

	Some vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) 
include session managers or other desktop programs which include "print portion
of screen" or "take a snapshot" options. Some platforms also have tools which 
can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example, 
have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals 
have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.

	Some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct 
support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package 
to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?

	If you need color PostScript in particular, you can 
	- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color 
PostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv 
	- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS.
You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick 
distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?

	This can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider 
instead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?

	The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ 
Portable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting 
among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps, 
gray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently;
the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.
	Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in 
particular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.
It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).

	Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a
version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are 
later versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.  
Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; 
see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.

	xv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), 
can read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, 
GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, 
contrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned 
formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on 
it, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; 
see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.

	The Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.
Conversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available
via FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, 
and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.

	The Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads
and writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image
manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as
contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.

	The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar 
to PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*, 
weedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.

	Xim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential 
interactive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is 
a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and 
Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif, 
xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a
library and command-line utilities for building your own applications.

	ImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from 
export's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display
images on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF
from other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.

	xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written
to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining
simple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems
with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed
as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on
export.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90]
xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.

	A version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool
is available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package 
also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget. [12/91;5/92]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  28)  How can I change the titlebar of my xterm window?

	The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will
cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the
string which appears in the window titlebar.
	A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell:
		echo "ESC]2;TEXT^G"
where ESC is the escape key, TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed,
and ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character).

	Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to
the current working directory when you change directories:
		alias newcd 'cd \!*; echo -n ESC]2\;$cwd^G'

	The digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should 
change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name 
used in the icon, use the digit '0' instead, and use '1' to change only the 
icon name.

	Note: another way to do this, which prevents an incorrect display of
the local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell, is to wrap the
escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself.

	Note: on an IBM RS/6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with
a ^V.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  29)  Where can I find the xterm control sequences?

The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file 
ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z.

O'Reilly's Volume 3, the X User's Guide, includes an R5 version of the control 
sequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93, and a Motif version of 
the book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version
of the control sequences. [1/93]

Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document
and also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a 
compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 
sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was 
published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).

In a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.

Subject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm, et al, fail against the R4 server?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?

	In order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to 
"stty pass8" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as 
	XTerm*font: 	-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1
	XTerm*boldfont:	-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1
[The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]

In addition, you may want to set this in your shell:
	setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1

        For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with 
the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using
`man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (') 
is Alt-'.

(gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu); 6/92]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  32)  Why are my xterm menus so small?

	You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give 
a resource specification like this:
		xterm*geometry: 80x24
then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to
80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. 
But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only
the terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:
		xterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?

	You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. 
However, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for 
manipulating the selection will help; e.g. 
	% xselection PRIMARY | lpr
finds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a 
window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of
the selection and other properties. A version is on export.
	Also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be
adapted to do this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?

	You can use several environment variables to control how resources are 
loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and 
XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for 
application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most
one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from
the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.

	Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a 
way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.
Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also 
have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could 
set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up 
app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your
OPENWINHOME is located):
	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N

The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see 
XtResolvePathname()):

        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the
                application's class name.
        %T      The value of the file "type".  In this case, the
                literal string "app-defaults"
        %C      customization resource (R5 only)
        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.
        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. "ja_JP.EUC")
        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. "ja")
        %t      The territory part of the display's language string
        %c      The codeset part of the display's language string

	Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is 
"Myterm". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the 
example omits locale-specific lookup.)
	/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm
	$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm

	As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above 
app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it 
and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to 
search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.

	Let's consider another example. This time, let's set 
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working 
directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.
	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N

	The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands 
to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging 
because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file 
Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application
from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded
properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,
for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and
%S are useless.

	With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization 
resource value.  For example, you might run the "myterm" application like this:
	myterm -xrm "*customization: -color"

	If one of your pathname specifications had the value
"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C" then the expanded pathname would be
"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color" because the %C substitution character 
takes on the value of the customization resource.

	The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:
		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\
		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\
		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N

	(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in
this batch of default settings.)

	The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is 
		<root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5)
		<root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5)
		<root>/%N%C:\     (R5)
		<root>/%L/%N:\
		<root>/%l/%N:\
		<root>/%N:

	<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory 
if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other 
than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.

	Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find 
your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR 
to ".", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 
compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to "./", a dot followed 
by a slash.

Subject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?

The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a
program to change the background before loading the resources; for example, 
your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line 
	DisplayManager.0.authorize: false 
to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also 
	DisplayManager*xrdb:	/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb
where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:
	#!/bin/sh
	#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources
	/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap
	/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*
Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.  Note that this is a 
general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client.

Subject:  36)  Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my .xsession file?

	When xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login
files. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script;
or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and
source it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or,
if you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your 
.xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting
your .xsession file off with "#!/bin/csh". 
	If this doesn't work, also try starting off with:
		#!/bin/sh
		# Reset path:
		PATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?

	There are several ways to avoid having to do a "setenv DISPLAY ..."
whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.
	One solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It 
includes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and
xrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine.
A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.
	One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse
(mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from
132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and
$DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then 
propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain
		eval `xrlogind`
where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special 
format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to 
recreate the environment variables. [11/90]

	In addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on 
another host, and you find
		rsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY 
too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh 
can be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be 
		xrsh <HOST> xterm

  #! /bin/sh
  # start an X11 process on another host
  # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT
  # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu>
  # rsh $host -n "setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null"
  #
  # An improved version:
  # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson, jr@bbn.com)
  #       (generalized for sh,ksh by Keith Boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu)
  #
  # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.  This
  # script combines the best of both.

Subject:  38)  How can I design my own font?

	One way is to use the "bitmap" client or some other bitmap-editor (e.g.
Sun's icon-editor tool, post-processed with pbmplus) to design the individual 
characters and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate 
them into the BDF format. See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X 
Journal for more information.
	The R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained 
a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format
and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.
	An easier way is to use the "xfed" client to modify an existing font; a
version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is 
available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63], 
possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce
BDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.
	The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors,
XPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in
/pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed 
[5/91] in export:/contrib. 
	If you are a MetaFont user you can use "mftobdf" from the SeeTeX
distribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution
is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.
	The GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe,
a font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.
	The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these
tools to modify a font.
	Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is
in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?

	After you have built the font using your system's font-compiler, 
installed it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent
(e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp 
$dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the 
directory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in
that directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably 
leaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in 
the path.)
	Sometimes your "xset +fp $dir" command fails with a BadValue error:
		X Error of failed request:BadValue
			(integer parameter out of range for operation)
		Major opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)

	This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or
that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The
mention of an "integer parameter" in the message is spurious.)

-- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file
   system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your
   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an
   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. "xset +fp ~/myfonts") and
   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.

-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server
   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file
   "fonts.dir".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're
   running OpenWindows, look for the file "Families.list".  If you can't find
   it, run bldfamily(1).)

-- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a
   proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for
   example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.
   Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for
   Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work
   for X11Rn.

Subject:  40)  How do I convert a ".snf" font back to ".bdf" font?

	A tool called "snftobdf 1.4" is part of the bdftools package, which is 
available from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from 
crl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?

	der Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and 
produces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be 
used as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can 
understand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools 
such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail 
from mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]
	In addition, the R5 program "fstobdf" can produce bdf for any font that
the R5 server has access to.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?

	The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation,
but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to
standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file 
contrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is 
for a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for 
creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers 
which do not use the MIT font scheme.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  43)  How do I add ".bdf" fonts to my DECwindows server?

	The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the ".pcf" format.
You can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc
font-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a
performance hit.

Subject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?)
I want to be able to do something like this:
	xclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave

	You can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the 
same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because 
of this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since 
there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore, 
neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap 
converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a 
resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for 
use in many of its widgets, however.
[courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]

However:
	A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of 
the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick 
(basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of 
image formats as a pixmap.

	The leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used 
by Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by
AT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM 
distribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write 
routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to
allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information
on the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is
available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on 
the R5 contrib tape. [A set of XPM icons collected by Anthony Thyssen 
(anthony@kurango.cit.gu.edu.au) is on export in contrib/AIcons.]

Subject:  45)  Why can't I override translations? Only the first item works.

	You probably have an extra space after the specification of the first

	Ctrl<Key>a:    beginning-of-line() \n\ 	
	Ctrl<Key>e:    end-of-line()
					      ^ extra space
The newline after that space is ending the translation definition.

	Alternatively, you can probably set the timezone in the shell from
which you invoke the xclock or oclock, or use a script similar to this:
	#!/bin/sh
	TZ=PST8PDT xclock -name "San_Luis_Obispo_CA" 2> /dev/null &

of various ftp, uucp, e-mail and US-mail sites for both xmh and MH is given in 
the monthly MH FAQ; one source is ics.uci.edu in the file pub/mh/mh-6.7.tar.Z.
If you do not receive the comp.mail.mh newsgroup or the MH-users mailing list,

	The default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun (for 4.0.3, at least)
delete "old" (unreferenced) files from /tmp -- including /tmp/.X11-unix, which

	This error, which typically goes on to say, "widget 11004 vs.

your program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking 
against was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure.
	However, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the 
X11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun OW
systems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library, 
and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you

that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster 
and gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access.
	[The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. A
Webster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu 
(129.79.254.192) in "pub/webster/NeXT-2.0".]
	Unless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site
which can grant you access, you are probably out of luck. 

	However, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up the

Hi

I am trying to implement a pointer feature in Xlib

I have multiple windows and all can take input and 
show output simultaneously on all other displays

I want to implement a pointer feature 

I would like to get the pointer to come up on all windows once 
I choose pointer in the menu and every one should be able
to see it

Can you give me some hints as to how I should proceed 
I am new to Xlib



replies will be greatly appreciated

Thank you

(please respond via email!)

Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working?  I'm not
having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with
O'Reilly's ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net.

The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because
XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does
(which makes no sense to me).

The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors, apparently because the
mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So
you can't actually edit any colors.

We have X11 R5 patch level 22; 8-bit pseudoColor visual.  I've poked around 
in the xcms code in Xlib, but without some understanding of the theory I have 
no idea what's going wrong.  Can somebody confirm if either of the 
above-mentioned programs work on their systems, or let me know if they fail 
for you too?  Please include what hardware/software/patch levels you have.

Any hints?

Please respond with email as I don't regularly read this group.

Thanks,
Karen

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  58)! Where can I get patches to X11R5?

	The release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced
in the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.

	Patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other
sites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the 
newsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in 
their source distributions of X11.

	People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has 
23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line
		send fixes #
where # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.

	Here are a few complications:
	1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request "5a", "5b", "5c" and 
"5d" separately
	2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was 
re-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris]
	3) fix 8 is in two parts: "8a" and "8b"
	4) fix 13 is in three parts: "13a", "13b", and "13c"
	5) fix 16 is in two parts: "16a" and "16b"
	6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which 
previously was optional
	7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff
by asking for "PEXlib.uu.[1234]".
	8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, "22a" through "22i"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?

	The xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail 
it a request, and it mails back the response.
	Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The
xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can 
have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). 
The xstuff server treats the "Subject:" header line just like any other line 
of the message.
	The archives are organized into a series of directories and 
subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an 
index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the 
subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.

	1) The command "help" or "send help" causes the server to send you a 
more detailed version of this help file.
	2) if your message contains a line whose first word is "index", then 
the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If
there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then 
the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. 
For example, you can say "send index fixes" (or "index fixes"). A message that 
requests an index cannot request data.
	3) if your message contains a line whose first word is "send", then the
xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name 
an item, you give its directory and its name. For example
                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9
	You may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many 
safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large 
amounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed
amount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the 
day's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. 
Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out 
shortest-first.
	4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting 
return addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If 
you happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like
        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu
or
        path bar!foo!frotz
in the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.

	The xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If 
your mailer deals in "!" notation, try sending to 
{someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.

Subject:  61)  Where can I get OSF/Motif?
	
	You can obtain either OSF/Motif source or binaries from a number of 
vendors. 
	Motif 1.2.2 source is now available; it is based on X11R5.
	Motif 1.1 is based on the R4.18 Intrinsics and is currently [7/92] at 
1.1.5.
	An OSF/Motif source license must be obtained from OSF before source can
be obtained from the Open Software Foundation or any value-added vendor for
any version. Call the Direct Channels Desk at OSF at 617-621-7300 for ordering 
information.
	Various hardware vendors produce developer's toolkits of binaries, 
header files, and documentation; check your hardware vendor, particularly if
that vendor is an OSF member. 
	In addition, independent binary vendors produce Motif toolkits for
machines for which Motif is not supported by a vendor; the kits include varied 
levels of bug-fixing and support for shared libraries and are based on widely
divergent version of Motif:
	Quest (408-988-8880) sells kits for Suns, as well; 
	IXI (+44 223 462 131) offers kits for Sun3 and Sun4. 
	NSL (+33 (1) 43 36 77 50; requests@nsl.fr) offers kits for the Sun 3 
and Sun 4.
	Bluestone Consulting makes a kit for Sun systems.
	ICS (617-62-0060) makes several binary kits, notably for Sun, DEC.
	HP and DEC have announced support for Motif on Sun systems.
	Unipalm (+44-954-211-797) currently offers for Sun systems a Motif 
Development Kit including X11R4 and based on Motif 1.1.2. The US distributor is
Expert Object Corp (708-926-8500).
	BIM ships Motif 1.1 binaries for Suns. Shared library support is 
included. Contact Alain Vermeiren (av@sunbim.be) or Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be) 
at +32(2)759.59.25 (Fax : +32(2)759.47.95) (Belgium).
	SILOGIC (+33 61.57.95.95) ships Motif 1.2 and Motif 1.1 on Sun 
machines.
	S.I. Systems offers Motif 1.2 for Solaris 2.1; info: 1-800-755-8649 in
USA and Canada.
	Metro Link Inc. (305-970-7353, sales@metrolink.com; in Europe contact
ADNT, (33 1) 3956 5333, UniVision (UK) Ltd. (44) 628 82 22 81) ships an 
implementation of X11R4 and Motif 1.1.2 (including a shared-library 
implementation of libXm.a) for the 386/486 Unix market.  Motif 1.1.2 is 
also available for Sun Sparc based workstations. It has also announced 
Motif 1.2 for Solaris systems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  62)  Does Motif work with X11R4? X11R5?

	Motif 1.2 is based on X11R5.
	Motif 1.1, available in source form from OSF as of August 1990, uses 
the "vanilla" X11R4 Intrinsics, where "vanilla" means "with just a few 
patches"; the file fix-osf which OSF distributes is obsoleted by MIT's patches 
15-17.  The file fix-osf-1.1.1 distributed with the 1.1.1 version or its 
subsequent modification needs to be applied after MIT fix-18, though.

	Motif 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 will work with X11R5 if X11R5 is compiled with
-DMOTIFBC; 1.1.4 and later should work with the vanilla R5, although there are 
some known new geometry-management problems.
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  63)  Where can I get toolkits implementing OPEN LOOK?

	Sun's XView has a SunView-style API. A version is on the X11R4 tape;
the latest [2/92] 3.0 sources are on export in contrib/xview3/.
	XView and X binaries for the Sun 386i ("roadrunner") are available for

Subject:  64)! Where can I get other X sources? (including R5 modifications)

	The MIT Software Center ships the X Test Suite on tape.

	A multi-threaded version of Xlib based on X11R5 patch 12 is now 
available for anonymous FTP from (new version 1/93):
        DEC on gatekeeper.dec.com (16.1.0.2) in /pub/X11/contrib/mt-xlib-1.1
        MIT on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) in /contrib/mt-xlib-1.1

	HP has made available drivers to permit the building of the X11R5
sample server on the HP 9000 Series 700 workstations; the files are on
export.lcs.mit.edu in ~ftp/contrib/R5.HP.SRV. [8/92]

	User-contributed software is distributed through the newsgroup
comp.sources.x, moderated by Chris Olson (chris@imd.sterling.com); also check 
that group for posting information.

	Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has been creating a list of freely-
available X sources.  The list is stored on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib as
x-source-list.Z. It lists the main storage locations for the program and 
international sites from which it may be ftp'ed.

	The machine export.lcs.mit.edu has a great deal of user-contributed
software in the contrib/ directory; a good deal of it is present in current or 
earlier versions on the X11R3, X11R4, and X11R5 contrib tapes. There are also
directories for fixes to contrib software.  The file on export in
contrib/00-index.txt is a quick overall index of the software in that area,
provided by Daniel Lewart (d-lewart@uiuc.edu).

	These sites used to and may still mirror export and are of particular 
use for Australasia: Anonymous ftp: ftp.Adelaide.EDU.AU; ACSnet Fetchfile: 
sirius.ua.oz.

	The material on giza.cis.ohio-state.edu, which tends to duplicate 
the export archives, is also available via anonymous UUCP from osu-cis, at TB+ 
and V.32 speeds.  Write to uucp@cis.ohio-state.edu (same as osu-cis!uucp) for 
instructions. [the archive is now maintained by Karl Kleinpaste]

	A new west-coast UUCP X11 Archive is administered by Mark Snitily 
(mark@zok.uucp) and contains the full X11 distribution, the XTEST
distribution, an entire archive of comp.sources.x and other goodies.
	The machine zok has a TB+ modem which will connect to 19.2K, 2400, 
1200 baud (in that order).  The anonymous UUCP account is UXarch with password 
Xgoodies.  The modem's phone number is 408-996-8285.
	A sample Systems (or L.sys) entry might be:
   		zok Any ACU 19200 4089968285 in:--in: UXarch word: Xgoodies
	To get a current listing of the files that are available, download
the file "/usrX/ls-lR.Z".
	A full subject index of the comp.sources.x files is available in the
file "/usrX/comp.sources.x/INDEX".
	The machine has just the one modem, so please do not fetch large 
amounts of data at one sitting.
[courtesy Mark Snitily, 2/90]

In addition, UUNET Source Archives (703-876-5050) tracks comp.sources.x and 
provides 800MB+ of compressed programs on 6250 bpi tapes or 1/4" tapes.  It 
also mirrors export/contrib in its packages/X directory.

(daven@wpi.wpi.edu), and the FileNominator from the aXe distribution.
	The GhostView, Xfig, and vimage packages also include file-selector 
widgets.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  67)  What widget is appropriate to use as a drawing canvas?

	Some widget sets have a widget particularly for this purpose -- a
WorkSpace or DrawingArea which doesn't display anything but lets your Xt 
application know when it has been re-exposed, resized, and when it has received
user key and mouse input. 
	The best thing to do for other widget sets -- including the Athena set 
-- is to create or obtain such a widget; this is preferable to drawing into a 
core widget and grabbing events with XtAddEventHandler(), which loses a number 
of benefits of Xt and encapsulation of the functionality .  
	At least one version has been posted to comp.sources.x (name???). 
	The publicly-available programs xball and xpic include other versions. 
	The Athena Widget manual (mit/doc/Xaw/Template in the R5 distribution) 
includes a tutorial and source code to a simple widget which is suitable for 
use. 
	The Free Widget Foundation set contains a Canvas widget.

fonts and colors, a built-in BDF font compiler, and built-in standard 
colormaps. Upgrades to MacX are available by ftp from aux.support.apple.com. 
Info: 408-996-1010.  
	[Note: MacX is also the name of a vax-mac xmodem transfer utility.]

	Also: 

	Liken (1-800-245-UNIX or info@qualix.com) software enables monochrome
68000 Mac applications to run on a SPARC system running X. 
	Xport (1-800-245-UNIX (415-572-0200) or xport@qualix.com) enables Mac

Subject:  73)  Where can I get a fast X server for a workstation?

	The R5 server should be among the fastest available for most machines.

	Sun sells a "Direct Xlib" product which improves rendering for 
applications running on the same machine as the X server; the replacement Xlib
library accesses graphics hardware directly using Sun's Direct Graphics Access 
(DGA) technology.

	International Quest Corporation (408-988-8289) has an optimized R4 
server for Sun3/4 under SunOS 4.0.

	Unipalm have R4 Servers for Sun3 and Sparc platforms. These are 
optimised to use graphics hardware and will run with Sunview. Information:
+44 954 211797 or xtech@unipalm.co.uk.

	Xgraph's Xtool (408-492-9031) is an X server implemented in SunView 
which boasts impressive results on Sun 3 and SPARC systems. [6/90]

Several companies are making hardware accellerator boards:

	Dupont Pixel Systems (302-992-6911), for Sun.

	Megatek's (619-455-5590) X-cellerator board for the Sun 3 and Sun 4 is 
based on the TI 34020; the company claims performance improvements of 5x to 
10x over the sample X11R3 server.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  74)! Where can I get a server for my high-end Sun graphics board?

        Takahashi Naoto (Electrotechnical Laboratory, ntakahas@etl.go.jp) has 
modified the MIT X11R5 server to support the Sun CG8, CG9, and CG12 boards.  
The files are on export in contrib/Xsun24-3.[01].tar.Z.  Note that both files 
are necessary to build Xsun24-3.1.

	The JPL R5 Xsun Multi-screen server is a general purpose replacement
for the MIT server/ddx/sun layer; it provides for the screen to be split among
several monitors and implements several other features above the MIT 
implementation. Available on export.lcs.mit.edu in the file
contrib/R5.Xsun.multi-screen.tar.Z. [Kaleb Keithley, kaleb@thyme.jpl.nasa.gov,

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  75)  Where can I get an "X terminal" server for my low-end Sun 3/50?

	Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu) has written Xkernel; the current
version [1.4 as of 8/91, 2.0 expected RSN] is on sol.ctr.columbia.edu 
[128.59.64.40] in /pub/Xkernel.gamma. It turns a Sun 3/50 into a pseudo- X 
terminal; most of the overhead of the operating system is side-stepped, so it 
is fairly fast and needs little disk space.
	A similar approach is to run the regular X server by making /etc/init
a shell script which does the minimal setup and then invokes Xsun, like this
example script from mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.EDU:

#! /bin/sh
exec >/dev/console 2>&1
/etc/fsck -p /dev/nd0
case $? in
 	0)	;;
 	4)	/etc/reboot -q -n
 		;;
 	8)	echo ND fsck failed - get help
 		/etc/halt
 		;;
 	12)	echo Interrupted
 		/etc/reboot
 		;;
 	*)	echo Unknown error in reboot fsck - get help
 		/etc/halt
 		;;

Try the 'M.Sc. Computing Science' course at the REAL Newcastle University.
It's a conversion course, but at least they teach REAL programming.

In the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL, Simula, Prolog, Miranda.
Also, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.

They also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software
engineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory,
and some stuff about comms.   

The PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and 
X Windows programming as well)
anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending
on your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching.

The one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thought
invaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry -
this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but
would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough
course.

Yes, I know this sounds like a plug for the course, why not!

If you compile with 'make -k World' it will not stop on the

I suspect this is because VUE creates a window (probably OverrideRedirect)
that is the size of (or larger than) the Root Window. Because the window
manager does not know about this, you cannot move, resize etc. it. xv in the
mean time is busy changing your root window to whatever you have requested
but you never get to see it because VUE's window is overlaid on top of the root
window. 

Contact HP support and see whether VUE can support coloured bitmap format
such as xpm, if they cant then they probably create all their coloured
backdrops inside the code.

Hi,

I am programming in XView, SunOS 4.1.2 & OpenWindows 3.0. I would like
to rotate some text and display it. I did read the FAQ in comp.windows.x
but am not sure how do I translate it to XView. I would appreciate if
someone can give me tips on how to do it. Thanx.

	- Mahendra.

PS : As I am not a frequent news group reader, I would appreciate if
     answers/replies would be mailed to me. I will post a follow-up.

I don't know how many hours you've spent on this, but the Sun User
Group makes X11R5 available on CD-ROM to its members. The 1992.1 disk
has both sources and binaries and it sells for $50.  I've tagged a
table of contents and an orderform on below if anyone's interested.

SUG CD 1992.1 is X11R5 and GNU on a CDROM, priced at $50 to SUG
members, including a caddy!

SUG's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible
service and value-added to our members.  Last year, the SUG 1991 disk
contained plug-and-play X11R4, 20MB of additional essential binaries,
almost 200MB of Sun patches, fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net
postings, priced at only $250.

Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be
produced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added
as possible.  To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk
set, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the second
available later in '92, containing more SPARC binaries and other
useful material not found on previous disks.

The SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce, contains
a lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great
service to make it available right away to our members (and this
pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per
disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a
SUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live
within the US or $55 outside.

The SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used
by PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a
total of 543MB of material, including:

X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after
the initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0
distribution are included (109MB of material).  Binaries for: X Xsun

COPIES OF CONTRIBUTED X SOURCES (from export.lcs.mit.edu/contrib),
which were then uncompressed/untarred into source directories (212MB).
These are sources only, and some of them were (after the date of
production of this disk) included in the MIT contrib-2 and contrib-3
distributions.

(88MB).

We have recently purchased a Tektronix xterminal, and I'm having
a problem with it. We have a graphics widget that we wrote to
display waveforms, and it doesn't work on the xterminal. the buttons,
etc, all show up, and it seems to take the 'right' amount of time to
draw, but nothing is visible in the graphics window. I
have no clue as to where to start looking: the program works fine
on all our suns (3s and 4s, color and B&W). could anyone suggest a
line of attack for this problem?

TekXpress XP380 color xterminal running 6.0.0. host is a Sun IPX
running SunOS 4.1.3 and X11R5, PL17.

I am new to X programming, so please bear with me....

I am trying to have a dialog box that returns it's value upon the
user entering a new value and hitting the <return> key. (don't want
to have a "done" button).  The piece of code below will work if
I exclude the XtNvalue argument but will not work as is. Can someone
shed some light on this or suggest a better way?  Ultimately I will
have several areas active at the same time to allow a user to modify
parameters in the program.  


Thanks for your help,

I agree that this is a side track, but it is funny that I skip so many
other articles (threads) but I couldn't resist reading this one.

My beliefs, opinions, and expressions are strictly my own and do not
represent or reflect any official or unofficial policies or attitudes
of any other person or organization....
 
but.  I have heard that Ford Motor Company has (had) a recruiting bias
toward engineers and away from computer science graduates.  The reasoning
is supposedly to better meet long range personnel requirements.  This is
evidenced by the large number of CS people who are employed via contracts
and are not brought on board except in special circumstances.  This is
a generalization which obviously doesn't always hold true, but there are
statistics.  Furthermore, most "software engineering" at Ford gets done
by electrical engineers.  I know of 2 univerities that have merged the
computer science department and the electrical engineering so that you
can get a computer degree which qualifies you for much more than programming.

But since my beliefs and opinions are merely figments of my distorted
imagination I suppose I should keep it to myself.

xwd -id xxxxx where xxxxx is the window id obtained from XtWindow(widget).

Hi!

I remember reading (or hallucinating) that NCD's PC-Xremote functionality had 
been given, by NCD, to MIT for inclusion in X11R6.  Is this true?  If so,
(set mode/cheap) can I just wait for X11R6 to get compressed serial line
X server support?

Thanks!

published in The X Resource, but am looking for something with a bit
more depth to it.

Hi

I am trying to implement a pointer feature in Xlib

I have multiple windows and all can take input and 
show output simultaneously on all other displays

I want to implement a pointer feature 

I would like to get the pointer to come up on all windows once 
I choose pointer in the menu and every one should be able
to see it

Can you give me some hints as to how I should proceed 
I am new to Xlib



replies will be greatly appreciated

Thank you

What I want to be able to do is to set the cursor
color to the same as the forground color that is set
for that xterm.

From the man page.....

-cr color
 This option specifies the color to use for text cur-
 sor.   The  default  is  to  use the same foreground  <---
 color that is used for text.  <---

However this doesnt seem to be the case, it appears to default to black
or to whatever XTerm*cursorColor is set to.

Feel free to point me at the relevant FM or whatever,
Cheers,

Can anybody tell me how to use the Xmu function "XmuCvtStringToWidget". I
want to specify a widget name in a resource file so that I can connect
two widgets together on an XmForm. ie.

MyProggy*MyListSW.topWidget:               MainTextSW

However, when I run the program, I get the message:

Warning: No type converter registered for 'String' to 'Window' conversion.

(Just like the manual sez).

I have managed to find this bit of code which seems to be the correct way
to go about this:

    static XtConvertArgRec parentCvtArgs[] = {
        {
            XtWidgetBaseOffset,
            (XtPointer)XtOffsetOf( CoreRec, core.parent ),
            sizeof(CoreWidget)
        }
    };

    XtSetTypeConverter( XtRString, XtRWidget, XmuCvtStringToWidget,
                            parentCvtArgs, XtNumber(parentCvtArgs), XtCacheAll,                                NULL );


However, I haven't got a clue where to put it! The example code I have seems
to suggest I can only do this if I am creating my own widget; but elsewhere it
says that I can add it to a widget's "class_intialize" function. HOW? What's
one of those? :-(

If anybody has any code to do this, please let me know the trick - I'm sure
this is a FAQ.

Thanks in advance,

Rik.

PS: What are the header files "CoreP.h" and "IntrinsicsP.h" - should I use
    these or "Core.h" and "Intrinsics.h" (OK I know RTFM:-)

I am trying to write an image display program that uses
the MIT shared memory extension.  The shared memory segment
gets allocated and attached to the process with no problem.
But the program crashes at the first call to XShmPutImage,
with the following message:

X Error of failed request:  BadShmSeg (invalid shared segment parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  133 (MIT-SHM)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_ShmPutImage)
  Segment id in failed request 0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  741
  Current serial number in output stream:  742

Like I said, I did error checking on all the calls to shmget
and shmat that are necessary to create the shared memory
segment, as well as checking XShmAttach.  There are no
problems.

If anybody has had the same problem or has used MIT-SHM without
having the same problem, please let me know.

By the way, I am running OpenWindows 3.0 on a Sun Sparc2.

Thanks in advance--
John C.

xdm does XGrabServer when it's running in secure mode (so do some
screen-locks).  There's really no simple way to tell this is the case.

You can take xdm out of secure mode;  probably not too cool.

You can wrap your call to XOpenDisplay in some code which solicts
a future SIGALRM and longjmps past the XOpenDisplay from the signal
handler.  An example of this can be seen in the xdm sources.

Note that longjmping out of XOpenDisplay probably causes a memory
leak;  any program functioning this way probably needs to exit() 
regularly.

What I like about GUI's:

	- The ability to view and manipulate a group of objects, files,
	  text, directories, etc. and and manipulate them in some way
	  such as delete, copy, paste, rename ...

	- The ability to have several applications / screens visible
	  and accessable at the same time.

	- Being able to do a standard set of functions easily and
	  quickly on an unfamiliar operating system. I am familiar with
	  the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally
	  I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use.
	  If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do
	  fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is
	  a long and painful experience.


What I hate about GUI's:

	- Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess
	  I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a
	  computer with one hand and use the other for holding something
	  like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my
	  favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be
	  done with one hand such as navigating, cutting, pasting,
	  searching, opening and saving files, etc. The main thing I
	  need to use both hands for is entering text.

	I guess I need to get one of those mice with, like, 20 buttons
	or something and then I will have the best of both worlds.

Hi,
	I am in the process of making the decision whether I should
write c++ wrappers for motif myself or use Motif++ or Interviews.
Though I have downloaded the tar files, I fail to see any
documentation. I have two questions:
	1) If you have used these or similar c++sy toolkits what has been
your experience?
	2) Where do I find reference books /documentation for them?

any and all input will be greatly appreciated.

Can anyone recomend a good book or article on inter-client communications
BESIDES I.C.C.M.?

I've looked everywhere I can and it seems everyone tells you how to do it
but nobody SHOWS you how.  O'Reilly has no examples, ICCM has no examples,
Asente & Swick give no examples - in fact most of the books I've looked at,
if they discuss ICC at all, simply give a condensed version of the ICCM and
then refer you to the ICCM.  I did find one example of how to use Atoms and 
Properties in Young's book and five hours after I bought Young's book I had
my applications talking to each other.

I am not sure, however, if thats the best way.  I'd like to stay independent 
of Unix so pipes and/or sockets probably aren't the way to go.  But within X
one can also use messages, the clipboard, and perhaps window groups.

I need a text that discusses the various methods, discusses which method is best
for which purpose, and gives examples.  Without examples it's all just words.

Thanks in advance

Ross

Well I am not sure if this is the right newsgroup to ask, but let me try anyway.
I am running xterm and like all UNIX users, I run man <something>. Recently,
I switched to Solaris 2.1, and their man pages are littered with ".I" directives
that are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm.
The resulting output (admittedly a personal taste) is very ANNOYING to look at.
Back when I was using SunOS 4.1.2, I remember their man pages have some keywords
displayed with underlining....

So my question is how do I change the xterm's behaviour under ".I" directives 
for nroff man pages, to perhaps underlining, or at least disabling it. (".B" 
directives are fine, I like them. And of course, I don't want to go in and edit
the man pages inputs...) Somehow, xterm allows one to specify both a normal font
and a bold font, but not an italic font??

Any pointers, suggestions are greatly appreciated.
Thanks -- John

P.S. Running xterm -rv won't work, I tried...

Alsys has produced a paper outlining how to use C++ with TeleUSE.  You can
get a copy from your local sales rep or call us at (619)457-2700.

As mentioned, it is very straight forward using the Dialog language
(similar to Visual Basic).

This is incorrect.  Sun has made no such claim regarding Devguide, and as 
manager of the Devguide engineering group I can state with authority that
work on Devguide is continuing apace.  We had quite a strong show of interest
from the Devguide user community at last week's Solaris Developer's Conference.
Devguide is being advocated not only as a valuable future builder tool, but
as an important bit of transition technology that will help sustain current
customers and facilitate their migration to the COSE Desktop Environment.

If you have specific questions about Devguide availability, etc., you can 
contact Tali Aben, our Devguide Product Marketing person, at (415) 336-3536.

Interesting, I'd like to know why.

But try it again on a single ethernet with 100 X terminals on it,
and I think you'll find it much slower.

Hi,

I just compiled the X11R5 distribution for a Sun3/SunOS4.1.1.  I also
compiled the public domain xview3 (with olwm) distribution.  I have some
old 3rd-party application binaries that are SunView programs.  How do I
get them to work under xview3 and olwm?  (I tried using the OpenWindows
version 2 "svenv" program, but it did not work.)

I do not have news access....that's why I am mailing this directly.  Also,
is there an email alias where my questions can get to comp.windows.x or
comp.windows.open-look?  PLEASE RESPOND TO fwr8bv@fin.af.mil

Thanks,
Shash

Look in xfig.  It has two types of spline algorithms and is relatively simple.
Xfig is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in

BTW, the X11 tools come as sources. The sillyness of most vendors lets you

Anyway, have a look onto xgrab/xgrabsc. It does the IMHO best job for
this, including compression.

	HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF X -- monthly posting

	    Compiled by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca)

  More RAM, Faster CPU's, More disk space, Faster Ethernet...  These
  are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the
  performance of your workstation.

  Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more
  hardware is always even a necessity.

  This "FAQ" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different
  people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X
  Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.

  Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must
  balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal
  decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many
  subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.

  This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course
  many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.
  However, they are outside the scope of this document.

    [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system
    performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook
    "System Performance Tuning" by Mike Loukides.  I'm about 25% of the
    way through reading it, and it looks like a well-written
    comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm unaware of any
    other similar books.  --ed.]

Introduction & Administrivia
-----------------------------

  This document is posted each month, on or around the 15th, to the
  Usenet news groups comp.windows.x, news.answers, and comp.answers.
  If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few
  months old (see the "Last-modified" date above) you should probably
  locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.

  If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does
  not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can
  retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.

  There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about
  them and how to access them, please see the "Introduction to the
  news.answers newsgroup" posting in news.answers.

  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document
  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If
  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by
  sending a mail message to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu with the
  command "send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups" in the message body.

-----------------------------
What about the "Other X FAQ"?
-----------------------------

  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and
  well written "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" document.
  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates
  on performance.

  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with
  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:
	"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4".
  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).

---------------
Window Managers
---------------

  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different
  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a
  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this
  point, most respondents have agreed upon "twm" as the best candidate
  for a speedy window manager. 

  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,
  is turning off unnecessary things like "zooming" and "opaque move".
  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the
  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping
  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)

  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:
  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is
  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)
  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the
  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.

------------
The X Server
------------

Which Server?
- - - - - - -
  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.
  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.

  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between
  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to
  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute
  to less paging.  
         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),
                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]

  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law
  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be
  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.
  You can expect to get "*very* large speedups in the server" by not
  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results
  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial
  compilers on the market.

Locking the Server into RAM?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and
  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help
  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few
  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone
  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.

Starting your Server
- - - - - - - - - - -
  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :
    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep
    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my
    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...
    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.

  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  

  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of
  why this works, which I have summarized here:

    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to
    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by
    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of
    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the
    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you
    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself
    sorted out before the clients start up.

    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X
    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources
    being fetched, programs initializing state and "databases" and so
    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this
    initialization is done ("The process has reached a steady state"),
    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.
    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your
    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your
    workstation's limited resources

  This is most definitely a "Your Mileage May Vary" situation, as there
  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap
  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients
  you are starting, etc.

  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &

  I've experimented with:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &

  I've even tried:
	(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &
  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &

    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had
    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down
    into a "steady state" before the sleep expired and all my clients
    were launched. ]

  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with
  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to
  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.

Fonts
- - -
  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts
  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.

  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one
  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or
  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.
  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded
  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer
  fonts will be loaded by the server.
			      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),
			        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]

  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13
  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since
  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.

  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):
    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.
    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.

About the Resources File
- - - - - - - - - - - - -

    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves
    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)

  One suggestion:

    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum
    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your
    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true

    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific
    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your
    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:

	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N

    [ The "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" FAQ contains
    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.
    --ed.]

    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from
    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,
    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same
    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system
    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to
    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files
    with the same name.

    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).
		    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),
		         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),
		             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).
	     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]

  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following
  benefits:

    - Easier to maintain / more usable.

    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER
      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally
      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.

    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort 
      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.

  It also has drawbacks:

    - the application that you are interested in has to load an
      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to
      make that much of a performance difference, and you might
      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an
      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the
      application without having to "xrdb" again.

    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When
      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and
      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.
      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!

      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped
      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource
      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why
      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*
      provide any error message when it encountered the C style
      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted
      processing the resource file.

      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef
      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this
      method of resource management.

    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For
      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their
      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.

    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files
      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client
      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the
      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find
      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)

  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)
  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my
  .Xdefaults file, and to use the "separate resources files" method for
  clients that I seldom use.

Define Your Display Properly
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In
  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to 
  "<hostname>:0.0", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you
  should set your DISPLAY variable to "unix:0.0" or ":0.0".  By doing this
  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same
  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.
			[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]

  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further
  explanation of how to properly set your display name.

  "I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have
  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when
  the DISPLAY isn't set specially."
			      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)

  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change
  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.
  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle
  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT
  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if
  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]

  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think
  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also
  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there
  a smaller clock program than xclock?

  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large
  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.

  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients
  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]

  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject
  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are
  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather
  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using
  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In
  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually
  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.

  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try
  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif
  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in
  more than one toolkit library.

  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client
  programs would work best together in that environment.

A Better Clock for X
- - - - - - - - - - -

1) xcuckoo
   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)
   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu

   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.
   Saves screen real estate.

2) mclock
   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)
   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar

   Non Xt-based.  Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look
   very much like MIT oclock, or mostly like xclock purely by changing
   resources.

  Of course, the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources, and 
  takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall.

A Better Terminal Emulator for X
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  From the README file distributed with xterm:

  +-----
  |		 Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here
  |
  | This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution.
  | ...
  +-----

  Ugly maybe, but at my site it's still the most used.  I suspect that
  xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.
  Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.

  If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines
  to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),
		   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]

1) Xvt
   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :
   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z

   "...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get
   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as
   xterm is rather a hog! "

   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to
   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current
   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that
   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any
   yet.

   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with
   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He
   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For
   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling
   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap
   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm
   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard
   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text
   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.

   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it
   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets
   brought into memory.

   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of
   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.
   If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.
   Specifically: How much RAM each occupies, how much swap each needs,
   relative speed of each

2) mterm
   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)
   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in
     /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax.

   "I also have my own terminal emulator.  Its major lack is
   scrollback, but some people like it anyway."


Tuning your client
- - - - - - - - - -

  Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.

  From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif
  Text Field Widgets:

    I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I
    was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,
    particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was
    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource
    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget
    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.
    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the
    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user
    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not
    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference
    on a [slower system].

  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots
  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor
  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server
  requests?

-------------------------
Miscellaneous Suggestions
-------------------------

Pretty Pictures
- - - - - - - -
  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.

  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server
    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)

  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm
    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see
    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.

    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by
    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.

  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate
    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.

		      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu)

A Quicker Mouse
- - - - - - - -
  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen
  when you move your mouse.  I use "xset m 3 10" in my .xinitrc file,
  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of
  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.

  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for
  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different
  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  

  e.g. (for twm) :
      menu "mouse settings" {
        "Mouse Settings:"			f.title
	"  Very Fast"				! "xset m 7 10 &"
	"  Normal (Fast)"			! "xset m 3 10 &"
	"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)"	! "xset m default &"
	"  Glacial"				! "xset m 0 10 &"
      }

Programming Thoughts
- - - - - - - - - - -
  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :
    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of
    things you can do.  Some that stick out:

    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual
      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or
      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager
      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.

    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.

    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.
      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)

    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE
      difference.

    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the
      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable
      one.

  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :
    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc
    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based
    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying
    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some
    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the
    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)

  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]

  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :

  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.

    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but
    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the
    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most
    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to
    run through it's event-loop again and again.

  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.

    This "Gfx Context Switching" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,
    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed
    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching
    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will
    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the
    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).

Say What!?
- - - - - - 
  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:

  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :
    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs
    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your
    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the
    same operation between client and server.

  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received
  the following confirmation...

  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):
    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big
    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage
    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This
    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was
    essential when I only had 8 MB.

  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :
    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as
    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a
    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in
    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.

  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :
    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's
    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate
    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they
    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your
    action.

    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2
    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going
    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved
    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing
    even fewer context switches.

----------------------------
Other Sources of Information
----------------------------

  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System
  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.

  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):
    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper "Improving X
    Application Performance" by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang, in
    Issue 3 of The X Resource.

    An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992
    conference proceedings.

    This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers.

Hello,

   When starting bx if you recieve an error message saying
"cannot load app-defaults file..." check your XAPPLRESDIR
environment variable and then put the file BuilderXcessory 
( this is the app-defaults file for BX ) in the directory
specified by the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable.

   If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable
then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the
BuilderXcessory file is. You can do this using the setenv
command under csh. Note that the name ends in .ad so you will
have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to {BX}/%N.ad to get the
app-defaults to load correctly.

   To make sure the the app-defaults file can be read by all
the users, make sure that a copy of or a link to the app-defaults
file exists in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or 
/usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults, depending on how your system is
set up.

   Once you have taken care of this set the *systemDirectory
resource to be the directory in which you have installed BX. 
For example let's say I've installed BX in /t then my system
directory resource should be set like this :

*systemDirectory: /t/builderXcessory

    Thanks,

Have you set the foreground and background colors in w_gc1 to 
something other than 0 and 1?  The WhitePixel and BlackPixel macros
on your server may not return values suitable for depth 1 drawables.

Are you sure that the fifth plane of the data isn't all the same?  You could
have different pixel values in the image, but the fifth plane (0x10 == 16)
might all be the same value?

If you just want to see the plane of data and want better performance,
don't use ClipMasks, just use pixmap1 as the stipple in a stippled
rectangle fill.  Many servers are very stupid about handling complex
clip lists, and turn a bitmap clip region into hundreds and hundreds of
little clipping rectangles, and clips every drawing primitive against every
one of these little triangles.


Actually, I must also ask the FAQ's #1 most popular reason why graphics
don't show up: do you wait for an expose event before drawing your
rectangle?

IMHO this whole discussion named "Motif looks like MS-Windogs" is totally
stupid. The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif Window
Manager, that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat
similiar to this of the MS-W windowmanaging agent, however its name is.
But MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif, in fact, MWM and Motif can work
without each other, and if one doesn't like MWMs outfit for some reason,
he switches to another windowmanager. All this doesn't influence Motif,
which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications, and this toolkit
is IMHO uncomparable to MS-W, because it is much more wellorganized and
features alot of goodies more than the MS-W interface.

You cannot say "A Porsche looks like a VW Kfer" ONLY because they have the
wheel and the gear at the same position. Motif and MS-W are complete
different worlds, only one element of the Motif world has some gear and wheel
at the same position as MS-W.

   ...let me point out that both GUI-based word-processors and text-based
   formatters both have a language; one happens to be mouse- and
   action-based, and the other symbol-based.

True, but that's beside the point. This is a fact about an abstract model
of what the GUI users are doing, not about what they actually *are* doing.
This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer*
of the system. (NB: some users may see it, too, but only when they put
aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.)

I'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. After
all, that's what I do, too! I am saying that UI designers must carefully
distinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models, and they must
ultimately serve the user of the system, not the builder of the system. 


   I don't recall the actual stats, but something like 1 in 5 people can be
   categorized as a "symbol manipulator".

It would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this
claim. At any rate, I don't think this is evidence that 20% of users think
like programmers. Bankers, financial analysts, structural engineers ---
these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol
manipulation. But what they do is not programming, and programming is not
required to do what they do. 

To restate my previous point: yes, users want to build their own solutions;
no, they do not want to do programming to accomplish this.

 I have just finished building X11R5 on a 386 running Interactive Unix (SysVR3)
and I am having a problem with xterm.  On any font larger that 5x7 it messes up
characters that are types, the cursor seems to be "too" large, or splits into
a 1/2 reverse video, 1/2 outline block (which changes when the pointer is moved
into the window).  I am trying to use monospaced fonts (not -p- fonts).  Is
there any way of changing the appearence of the block cursor is an Xterm?

 Thanks

I currently use a window manager called ctwm which
is very similar to hp's vuewm. (i.e. 
it has multiple workspaces).  Is there a 
motif based window manager that has this 
same feature and is not a memory pig like vue?

  The OpenLook window manager source is available on the MIT contrib tapes
  or from  export.lcs.mit.edu  .I would suggest building this too, rather than
  using the version from OpenWindows. It is  olwm  v3.

I am creating a graphics program using the Athena widgets. I use
Xlib routines to install a custom Graphics Contex by obtaining the display,
and window variables with the XtWindowOfObject() and XtDisplayOfObject().
The object was one of the sub widgets.  
  The problem occurs that whenever a button is pressed or a menu is selected
the graphic contex reverts to the orginal one. I tried moving the allocation
of the graphic context before the allocation of the buttons but nothing
changed. I am preforming all of this manipulation before calling 
XtAppMainLoop().

Thank you for any help.

I have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++,
and a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination
of Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the
toolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I
have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result
in significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which
looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance,
but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not
significantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks
promising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'm
not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted,
and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The
other libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not make
sufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task.

At this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in
C, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited
to my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting body
comes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does me
no goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which
leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry
directions.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now
than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both
useless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only
library I'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spending
nearly $5000 to use it, and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause
short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and is
unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits
at the high end of the J curve.

I've been hearing rumblings about Fresco, and it sounds like it may be
what I'm looking for, but how far is it from release, or at least some kind
of availability?  How similar is it to InterViews?  If I code to InterViews,
will my code work with Fresco?  How about Motif?  I've heard some mention
of versions of InterViews which support Motif.  Will it be feasible to use
Motif with Fresco?

Any information would be much appreciated.

it doesnt matter what window mgr you running under, you can use the X
routine:
	XIconfiyWindow(display, w, screen_number)
		Display *display;
		Window w;
		int screen_number;

as in

	XiconifyWindow( XtDisplay(w), XtWindow(w), 0);

does that perform what you want??

I'm trying to set up an IPX for another group. I copied all the
X stuff that I compiled on my 4/280 (which runs SunOS 4.1.1) using
gcc 2.1, and most things run just fine. however, I did find a
couple of bugs, and when I try to recompile those clients on the IPX
(which runs 4.1.3), I get

ld: Undefined symbol
   _XShapeQueryExtension
   _XShapeCombineMask

I know that I can include libXext and get rid of those messages,
but I can't figure out why I get them on the IPX and not on the
4/280. any ideas?

Seeing as Motif has been adopted by Sun, IBM, HP +++ (can't remeber the
other members in the recent announcement), I'm sure you'll see it on
virtually every workstation (ie. Sun, IBM, HP and DEC must make up the
**VAST** majority of all hardware).

Ports of Motif to both 386BSD and Linux are available for a fee of about
$100.  This is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to
redistribute.  The activity in both the BSD and Linux news groups
pertaining to Motif has been high.

I can't see why.  If just about every workstation will come with Motif
by default and you can buy it for under $100 for the "free" UNIX
platforms, I can't see this causing major problems.


Side Note :
---------
All the X based code I am writing (and will distribute freely when
completed) is based on Motif because from a programmatic and also "look
and feel" point of view I like it the best (no flames on this one
please).

No doubt this is an old question, but I didn't find the answer in the
FAQs I could find, so - here goes:

I have a Sunview application that I want to convert to X (OpenLook,
Motiv, whatever). I remember hearing quite some time ago that there
are tools to accomplish this task.

	a) is that so?
	b) are they public domain?
	c) any good, i.e.
	d) advantages over reimplementing the interface myself?

Thanks,

Hi Xperts, some simple questions for you:

I've seen a lot of different terms, which seem to mean the same thing.
Who can give an exact definition what these terms mean:

	-) multi-screen
	-) multi-headed
	-) multi-display
	-) X-Server zaphod mode

Is there a limit how many screens/displays a single server can handle
(in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12) ?

How is the capability called, if I want to move the cursor from one
screen/display to another.

Any hints welcome.

Thanks, rainer.

Hello Motif World,

a few days ago I posted my announcement for an update of Motif++. I got
several requests to send the bindings per e-mail, and I know of several people
who have been using Motif++, and there are probably a number of people I am
not aware of who are also using Motif++.

My question is:

How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list, where
people can ask questions about Motif++, swap stories, and give new ideas about
new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the
user-community, as well as give me more insight in what people would like to
see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project, and this
way I can make a list of priorities, in what order things should be added, or
changed.

If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list, please take the time to
reply to this message, and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest, say
about 20 people or more, a mailing-list will be set up at my site, and I will
post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups.

Greetings,


I am using an X server that provides 3 visuals:
PseudoColor 8 bit, Truecolor 24 bit and DirectColor 24 bit.

A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different
from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is TC24).

In the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the
section about XCteateWindow, something like:
"In the current implementation of X11: When using a visual other than the
parent's, be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used 
in the window attributes when creating, or else a BadMatch occurs."

This warning, strangely enough, is only mentioned in the newer editions
of the X11R5 guides.

However, even if I pass along a suitable colourmap, I still get a BadMatch
when I create a window with a non-default visual.
The code looks like this:

------------------ cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ----------------

Window create_8bit_window_on_truecolour_display(dpy,width,height)
Display *dpy;
int width, height;
{
  Window win;
  XVisualInfo vinfo;
  XSetWindowAttributes attr;

  fprintf(stderr,"Opening 8 bit window...\n");
  if (!XMatchVisualInfo(dpy,DefaultScreen(dpy),8,PseudoColor,&vinfo)) {
    fprintf(stderr,"Your display can't handle 8 bit PseudoColor.\n");
    exit(1);
  }
  fprintf(stderr,"Using visual: %x\n",vinfo.visual->visualid);
  cmap = XCreateColormap(
           dpy,
           DefaultRootWindow(dpy),
           vinfo.visual,
           AllocNone
         );
  XSync(dpy,False);
  XInstallColormap(dpy,cmap);	/* ommision of this line gives same result */
  attr.colormap = cmap;
  win = XCreateWindow(
          dpy,
          DefaultRootWindow(dpy),
          10,10,
          width,height,
          CopyFromParent,       /* border width */
          8,                    /* depth */
          InputOutput,          /* class */
          vinfo.visual,         /* visual */
          CWColormap,
          &attr
        );
  return win;
}

--- cut here and you'll destroy your CRT -----

Executing this piece of code results in a BadMatch error.
Anybody who knows why?
If so, please drop me a line.



	Take care,

Hello,

Anyone know of any source code I can get to either create window 
dumps in GIF format, or convert an XWD (x window dump) file 
into a GIF? Really could be any format I can manipulate in DOS, 
i.e. PCX, BMP, etc.

later,

Well, more information is required...

1) What computer are you using?
2) What operating system are you using?
3) What kind of printer are you using?
	a) PostScript?
	b) HP-PCL?

Hi,

I wonder if it is possible for a parent window to paint over the area of
its childs. If it is not, then how could it be possible to implement a 
rubberband across multiple xwindows to select the objects that are
displayed one in each window?

Hello Everybody!

I have a little question:

Due to more features (PEX, Drag&Drop) many applications when linked with for
example Motif 1.2 instead Motif 1.1 need more memory in the Xserver.
X-terminals only have limited memory (normally no swapping possible). So my
question:

Is there a possibility to determine via X protocol calls the size of free
memory available to the Xserver?

So one can determine for example whether to start a PEX application with the
CSS on client side or on server side (when there is enough memory).

Please reply via e-mail, I'll summarize!

Sincerly,
        Matthias

Issue 5 of the X Resource (the published proceedings of the 7th Annual X
Technical Conference) has an paper by Mark Linton and Chuck Price
titled "Building Distributed interfaces with Fresco".

The summary describes Fresco (formerly known as XC++) as an X consortium effort.
Without doing a complete review of the paper, I'll just mention the goals
as stated in one section of the article.  the effort has the goal of providing
the next generation toolkit with functionality beyond the Xt toolkit or Xlib.
Features they want in FRESCO include:

lightweight Objects, such as Interviews Glyphs
Structured Graphics
Resolution independence
Natural C++ programming interface
edit-in-place embedding
distributed user interface components
Multithreading

This by no means captures the complete content of the paper. The Conclusions
sections mentions that a rough draft specification should be available in
early 93, with no schedule (paper presented in Jan 93) for a complete sample
implementation.

I am not affiliated with any of the people or places mentioned above.

If you specify the rootwindow when you are creating your GC. You may 
use Xlib to draw over multiple windows. 
I have an application that does something similar for rubber banding.

 curs_move = XCreateFontCursor (disp_data, XC_crosshair);

 geom_vals.foreground     = blck_pixl ^ grey_dark;
 geom_vals.plane_mask     = AllPlanes;
 geom_vals.line_width     = 0;
 geom_vals.function       = GXxor;
 geom_vals.subwindow_mode = IncludeInferiors;
 evnt_mask= GCForeground | GCPlaneMask | GCLineWidth | GCFunction
                                                     | GCSubwindowMode;
 geom_gcon= XCreateGC (disp_data, root_iden, evnt_mask, &geom_vals);



later I can move the rubber band or bands using the following logic

/**********************************************************************/
 void Tselect::move_bands (int delt_xloc, int delt_yloc)          /****/
stuff deleted ...
            XDrawRectangle (disp_data,   root_iden,  geom_gcon,
                            sele_pntr->rootx, sele_pntr->rooty,
                            sele_pntr->xlnth, sele_pntr->ylnth); undraw old one
            sele_pntr->papax+= delt_xloc;
            sele_pntr->papay+= delt_yloc;
            sele_pntr->rootx+= delt_xloc;
            sele_pntr->rooty+= delt_yloc;
            XDrawRectangle (disp_data,   root_iden,  geom_gcon, 
                            sele_pntr->rootx, sele_pntr->rooty,
                            sele_pntr->xlnth, sele_pntr->ylnth); draw new one
more stuff deleted
  hope this helps

  I think you will find that the active Linux and 386BSD communities are
  populated by enthusiasts who would object to paying *any* money for software.
  Otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix.
  An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always
  available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community, however, I'm not
  really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting
  (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, C library or compiler patches come
  out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for
  all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license.
  Hence, Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.
  Individuals may write software requiring Motif, but I doubt it is widely
  adopted.

I posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was 
able to help me.

The problem is that main_win.win is doing fine, but when I create 
detail_win.win, it does not receive it's initial expose events until 
main_win.win receives an event. Here are the relevent calls:

main_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),
                myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
                main_win.line_thick, fg, bg);
XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, main_win.text,
                main_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint);
main_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, main_win.win, 0, 0);
XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);
XMapSubwindows (mydisplay, main_win.win);
The event mask for main_win is:
	PPosition | PSize | StructureNotifyMask | ExposureMask| KeyPressMask | 
	EnterWindowMask | LeaveWindowMask;
The flags are
	PPosition | PSize

I then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values):
detail_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),
                myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
                detail_win.line_thick, fg, bg);
XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, detail_win.text,
                detail_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint);
detail_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, detail_win.win, 0, 0);
XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);
Event Mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask.


If anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail_win.win 
are not received until main_win.win receives an event I'd love to hear 
from them. Other that that everything works great so there must be some 
detail I'm overseeing.

Thanks for any tips

Hi,
     I just got myself a Gateway 4DX-33V and trying to configure
X11R5 for it.  Has anyone done this before ?  More specifically,
I need a correct Xconfig file entry that is set up for my 
graphics card and monitor.  I have a 15" Color CrystalScan 1572FS monitor
and a VESA LOCAL BUS ATI Ultra Pro with 1MB VRAM video card.

Any help will be extremely appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

/* one yet so I'm posting again! Sorry :-)                                  */

I'm having problems creating a cursor bigger than 64x64, I'm using Motif 1.1
X11R4 running HP-UX 8.07 - all the functions return valid results but no
cursor appears when the bitmap is bigger than the aforementioned size. I tried

using the following code:

unsigned int w,h;
XQueryBestCursor(XtDisplay(programArea), XtWindow(programArea), 72, 71, &w,
&h);

to return the nearest size to what I require however it returns 72 and 71 as
the width and height respectively. What am I doing wrong? and if not how can I
get round the problem!!

Thanks in advance

Your might take a look a PLPLOT.  Version 4.99c (actually beta v5.0)
can be found anonymous ftp from hagar.ph.utexas.edu, in the pub/plplot 
directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 From the README file of version 4.99c:

 This is the PLPLOT distribution.  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for
 many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size
 and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard
 x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,
 bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)
 may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different
 line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of
 distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in
 the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek
 alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts
 can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device
 drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile
 format and renderer.

 The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.
 The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly
 granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without
 consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT
 object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it
 is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely
 available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed
 somewhere in the documentation for the package.

 We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of
 user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any
 published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,
 which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that
 as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the
 kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest
 in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only
 afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on
 those which help us get our work done.

 PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically
 without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub
 routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any
 modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the
 header file "plplot.h"; see the documentation for more details.

 The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of
 several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex
 plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to
 the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained
 there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.  

 At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:

	 Unix:	SunOS
		 A/IX 
		 HP-UX
		 Unicos
		 DG/UX
		 Ultrix
		 SysV
		 Linux

	 Amiga/Exec
	 MS-DOS
	 OS/2
	 NeXT

 For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:
  - appendices to the PLPLOT manual
  - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

I have a peculiar color problem with MacX, Apple's Macintosh X server.
I'd like to know if others have seen the same problem. It's happened
with the current version (1.2), and with version 1.1.7.
When some types of client windows are displayed, parts of the windows
are in the wrong color; if the window is moved slightly, forcing the server
to repaint it, it is repainted in the correct colors. It doesn't happen
for xterm windows, but has happened for graphic windows and with some
Motif clients.

Hi *,

Has anyone out there compile a list of X security holes??  If
yes, will you please send me a copy of this??  If this is a
wrong group, please point me to a right one.  Thanks!!

BTW, the list doesn't have to contain the info "How to use
the holes?".  Instead, I need the info of how to detect
the holes, how to seal the holes, and how to monitor the 
activities if possible.

Any info is welcomed.  Thanks!!

I want to create a single-line Text widget for entering a small amount of text.

I want it to be of fixed width, but have a horizontal scrollbar that scrolls
automatically when the user types in order to keep the insertion point
visible.

In trying to do this I have two problems:

 - The addition of the horizontal scrollbar does not make the text widget
   taller, but instead it seems to cover part of the text.

 - The scrollbar does not scroll automatically as the user types in text
   in order to keep the insertion point visible.

Any help is appreciated.

Before I try to teach myself how to write a widget and (perhaps)
re-invent the wheel...

Is there a PD widget that displays (for example) an 8-bit grey-level
image in the same fashion that the Athena Plotter Widget can be used
to display a plot?

DEC does this only for their PX and PXG servers, known as 3D accelerators.
This boards have local offscreen memory which is limited and slow to
handle, thus they set this limit.

Will there be any support for round or circular widgets in Motif's next
release?. I'd love to have a circular knob widget which could be used
instead of a slider.

Didn't your operating system come with X?  SysV usually does as far
as I know.  You'd do best to contact the people from whom you bought
ths OS.  If you're running Linux or something similar, good luck. :)

Does the workstation you're using have hardware cursor support?  Or does
the server generate a software cursor.  You can generally tell the difference
just by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity,
it's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor, I think you're
probably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware
cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible
that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually
checking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just 
that.

In reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless
of what the server returns.

I'm having an X resource problem using Brian Wilson's wscrawl 2.0
(a wonderful interactive conferencing program, by the way).  I'm 
running OpenWindows 3.0 on a SPARC 1+ under OS 4.1.3.  I have
the following defaults in my .Xdefaults file (among many others):
  wscrawl.telePointerName:	Kevin
  wscrawl.syncScrollbars:		True
  wscrawl.continuousTelePointer:	True
  wscrawl.showPointerCoordinates:	False
  wscrawl*background:		LightBlue
  wscrawl*swindow*foreground:	yellow
  wscrawl*draw_area_frame*foreground:	Blue
  wscrawl*keyboardFocusPolicy:	pointer

Naturally, I exited the server and restarted it after adding
those lines to .Xdefaults .

If I run the following from a cmdtool (pwd = my home dir.):
  xrdb -m .Xdefaults
and then start up wscrawl, then all those defaults are used
properly.  Wonderful, yes?  Except that I can't get them to be
operative except by *manually* invoking the afore-mentioned
xrdb command.  If I try:
  xrdb .Xdefaults
the defaults "won't take."

So, I tried to change the xrdb call in my .xinitrc file from:
  xrdb  $HOME/.Xdefaults
to:
  xrdb -m $HOME/.Xdefaults

No go.  So I tried adding in:
  xrdb -m /home/kbw/.Xdefaults
at the beginning or end of my .openwin-init file.  Still no go.

Any notions what gives?  Thanks for the help.

Hi.

I use Emacs and I want to customize my keyboard better.
When I set up stuff in my .emacs with a keymap and define-keys,
I can only access certain of the keys on my X-Terminal's
keyboard. I can't get e.g. F10, Home, End, PgUp, PgDn; they all
seem to have either the same or no keycode. I have a feeling
this can't be fixed in emacs itself, but that I need to do some
xmodmap stuff. Can someone help me?

By the way, I've checked the X-FAQ and posted a similar message
to gnu.emacs.help to no response.

Currently I have the following in my .emacs file (inside a 'cond'):

 ((string-match "^xterm" (getenv "TERM"))
;; done by aj 8/92. I don't know what most of this does...
   (defvar xterm-map (make-sparse-keymap) "Keymap for xterm special keys")
   (define-key esc-map "[" 'xterm-prefix)
   (fset 'xterm-prefix xterm-map)
  ;;Keys F1 to F12
   (define-key xterm-map "224z" 'goto-line)        ;F1

"return_place" is probably incorrect.  It should be a pointer, not an
integer.  XGetWindowProperty() allocates memory, copies the data there,
and returns a pointer to the memory.  You should free the memory when
you're done.

The following problem is really bugging me,
and I would appreciate any help.

I create two windows:

w1 (child to root) with event_mask = ButtonPressMask|KeyPressMask;
w2 (child to w1) with do_not_propagate_mask = ButtonPressMask|KeyPressMask;


Keypress events in w2 are discarded, but ButtonPress events fall through
to w1, with subwindow set to w2.

FYI, I'm using xnews/olvwm.

Am I doing something fundamentally wrong here?

Shameless plug -- the Xaw3d widgets make Athena a much nicer

#No doubt this is an old question, but I didn't find the answer in the

#
#I have a Sunview application that I want to convert to X (OpenLook,
#Motiv, whatever). I remember hearing quite some time ago that there
#are tools to accomplish this task.
#
#	a) is that so?
#	b) are they public domain?
#	c) any good, i.e.
#	d) advantages over reimplementing the interface myself?
#

The simple answer is for you to obtain use XView to do this.  XView is a
one to one replacement for Sunview.  It should already be provided with
you Sun running OpenWindows.   It is also free available as part of the
contrib side of the MIT X11R5 release.

  Let me add another of my concerns: Yes, I can buy a port of Motif for "cheap",
but I cannot get the source for "cheap", hence I am limited to using whatever X
libraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of
Motif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have not
seen it myself).

  Currently, I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which
only three came with Motif. On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5
libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the
vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same
problem when X11R6 becomes available.

  The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do
not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True, I could buy another port of Motif,
but that sort of ruins the whole idea of "free", doesn't it?

    Cheers,

The code fragment looks reasonable, but is your logic valid?
Just because something appears in an 8 bit deep pixmap doesn't
mean every bit plane contains data.  Did you try each plane?

Yes, and you don't want to change this value if you're running Image type

I can think of two different methods that you could try. 1) use fork and 
execv 2) use the "system" called in your program.  I'm assuming that you're
running under the Unix OS of course.

We are currently evaluating GUI builders, initially for Motif but with
a wish to be flexible & portable.  We have been through the popular
names (UIMX, TeleUSE, XVT etc) and have been very impressed with what
we have seen of Galaxy from Visix.  I have spoken to current users
from a list supplied by Visix (happy users as you would expect), and
seen favourable comments on the net.  However, since it is fairly
expensive to get an evaluation license from Visix, I would like to
query the net for any negative experiences with Galaxy.  Did anybody
evaluate them and prefer another tool or use Galaxy and regret it or
find any mis-features ?

advTHANKSance,

I have two Motif Widgets. I would like to control one of them via the
keyboard and the other with the mouse. I set the keyboard focus on the first
widget, but as soon as I click the mouse on the second one, I lose the
keyboard focus on the first one. 

Could some kind soul show me how to do this?

It is actually worse than you think.  I have the same problem, and have
given up.  Emacs has an internal table (somewhere!) which defines what
keys it will accept, and this table is system-dependent.  I use a Sun
from my HP, and cannot get 'shift PageUp' to work - xmodmap is not
sufficient, or at least I haven't worked out how to make it work.
However, I CAN get ordinary 'PageUp' and 'shift CursorRight' to work,
and I do some customised things with them.

Note that the Emacs on my HP has no problem, and I am using exactly
the same xmodmap and Emacs configuration.

I am looking for a program I can insert into some code that will allow the title bar to be changed on a window dynamicly.  If one already is out there, I would appreciate a location so I don't have to create this from scratch.

Thanks in advance.

Is it possible to run an MIT R5 based Xserver on a Sun with a Rasterops TC
Colorboard (24bit board)?  I have the Xsun24 patches for supporting sun's
24bit frame buffers but does the rasterops appear as if its a cgtwelve or
something else?  I know nothing about the rasterops other than we might be
buying one to put in an IPX.

cheers

Begging everyone's pardon, I was not slamming Motif, nor was I necessarily 
plugging/flaming the two.  I was responding to the sweet blithe statement in:
 <rick.734610425@digibd> from rick@digibd.digibd.com (Rick Richardson)

This happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when
they are pleased with something that works, and they believe that others will
also be happy to use it.  I remember when _SunView_ was hot stuff (and am not,
by that statement, endorsing Sun and its products, this is just my experience),
and when OpenWindows became hot stuff, that was when I started hearing, as
mentioned before, the "socialistic masses" that were bent on destroying 
_anything_ that was deemed proprietary, including OpenWindows.  I mentioned
Motif in the same breath, because that is what Sun has decided to turn its
attention to, not because I hate it.  Mr. Richardson's position, I believe, is
a healthy one, and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to
flame and destroy NT, if it ever shows up, wanting instead everything to be
free, and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are 
no de facto standards.

It was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds.

Hi folks,

Does anybody know for a good 32-bit C++/C compiler for OS/2 that supports
OS/2 API and Microsoft windows (maybe Windows NT)?

Could some one please send me (or tell me where to ftp from) the patches required
 for xrolo so that  I can compile-in the SPARCStation phone-dialing feature?

I am using SunOS  4.1.1, and therefore don't have "multimedia/libaudio.h" or 
"multimedia/audio_device.h" and associated functions.

Just in case, our mail gateway only accepts msgs < 45Kb.

I am working on a project to provide an emergency management
information system.  In keeping with more classic command and
control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor
system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.  
I have a number of X level questions regarding this:

(We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be 
predominantly Sun's, probably with ports to RS/6000 as well).

I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured
such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens,
and not multiple X displays.   Given this:

	- Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple
	as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's
	nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between
	screens?

	- Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate
	screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there?
	What are they; who sells them...

	- Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a
	window frame and move a window from one screen to the next?

	- Is there any way for the application to transparently see
	multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware
	only provide for each screen to start at 0,0?

	- Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a
	system capable of using either multiple screens or a single
	screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate
	multiple screens instead)?  
	I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely
	on providing config files which will specify for each
	configuration the screen placement of each window in the
	application.  Any thoughts or suggestions from past experience
	are more than welcome.

G'Day

Windows NT is a step forward, but not by much. I guess for DOS users who
think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to 
be able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windows
users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for 
granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running 
3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even 
a real issue. My ideal operating system:

	Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize
	binaries and configure on the fly, so I don't have to have
	bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc...

	Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac 
	and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which 
	has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in 
	80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips.
	Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems.

	Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton 
	or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform 
	or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly.
	so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on 
 	my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.

	Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS
	or NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.

	Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have
	to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch
	or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.

In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight, clean
kernel so you can actually understand it. Anyone know of something like this ?

	adios
	     Ata <(|)>.

    Yip, we had the same problem; the only fix we found was to link static

As to how many clients may be display on a server, I believe the limit
would be how much memory is available to your server or allocated by the
server.

For better details, check the README. (For extensive details, you have
to with Xew-1.1.ps.Z, still haven't had time to update this one).

No new functionality has been added since 1.2 version. Raster widget
handles now expose events slightly more intelligently than before
(really had to do this when I added a simple program that uses X11R5
Athena Porthole and Panner widgets). The program demo/viewer.c is
very simple demonstration of panner/porthole usage (copied

One can't.  The application may not have been started from a terminal
emulator; if it was, the terminal emulator may not still exist, and if
it does it may be in no condition to be "pop[ped] to the top" (eg, it
may be iconified).  And even if you can, it may not do what you want -
consider a virtual-root window manager like tvtwm, with the relevant
window in a portion of the virtual desktop that's outside the real
desktop.

Some (but not all) X terminal emulators provide environment variables
giving a window ID.  Even if such a thing is present in the
environment, it may not be what you want; it may correspond to a window
on a different server, for example.

As applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms.  "multi-headed"
tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even
multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg,
a Sun with a cg4 display).  "multi-screen" and "multi-display" would,
if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning
of "multi-display" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and
pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing
"multi-screen" would: a system that provides multiple Screens.

"zaphod" is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the
pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the
screen.

There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at
most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays
on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can
be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a
limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation
inherent to X.

What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular
implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit
of 12 inherent to X, the author of the article had no business writing
about X.

It applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only
recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention.
The necessity it refers to has always been there, but it's been
implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of
the new window.

This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to
provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is
CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't
match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a
border-pixel, and the problem should go away.

There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that
CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to
XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines
CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so
you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib
implementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, I'm
not entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.)

No.  Even if you could, the answer could be out of date even before you
get it (even if you grab the server, it could be taken up by buffering
user actions).  You should just try to do whatever you want; a BadAlloc
error is your indication that insufficient server memory is available.

Yes, but it's not an attribute of the window; it's an attribute of the

I have the exact same problem when running Hewlett Packard's Microwave Design
System (MDS) from an HP 380 unix box and running MacX 1.2, Sys 7.0.1*.
Normally, MDS draws a window with a deep blue backround, but occasionally
it becomes a light blue and all the text, etc, inside the window become
"washed out" (nearly invisible). I thought that it was just something
brain dead that I was doing or a subtle conflict with another app or INIT.

By slightly moving the window, and forcing a re-draw, the colors get corrected.

I would suggest skipping olwm and getting olvwm instead. This version of the
olwm window manager implements a virtual desktop that I find really handy even
on large monitors. 

This version is also available at export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/olvwm3.tar.Z.
The README file also suggest getting the files in /contrib/xview3.

In my case, I built the X Server first, Xview second, then olvwm. All of these
were installed into /usr/X5. Once I verified the server worked correctly,
I happily issued "rm -rf /usr/openwin/*".

Using gcc 2.3.3 to build all of the above resulted in a windowing system that 
is, for all intents and purposes, identical to OpenWindows 3.0 and that is     
incredibly faster. There is a bit of tweaking you will have to do if you want
things to work _exactly_ like OpenWindows, but not much.

Hello, 

	way back in the mists of time, I had a set of patches written
by Richard Caley (I believe to the standars distribution, patch level
6) which added regular expressions in the .tvtwmrc file, multiple icon
regions, squeezable icons, and f.deleteordestroy function. I still
have the patches, however, I can no longer find the sources to which
they applied ;-). 

	I'd appreciate if some kind soul could send me a pointer to
where I could find the sources. Has anyone updated the patches for R5?
(Richard? are you out there? pretty please?)

	Thanks in advance.

We've been using it for a year on Unix (Sun and HP) and Windows platforms.  In my
opinion, it is the best toolkit on the market.  It supports a rich API to a high
level IPC mechanism, file system abstraction, memory management, command driven
application development, drawing, geometry management, and, oh yeah, Open Look,
Motif, MS-Windows and Mac (at the flip of a switch).

Actually .. the problem is that you have to build with LD_LIBRARY_PATH
unset as well as LD_RUN_PATH.

Or read fixes 9, 10, and 11 to the MIT distribution.  This is a known 
problem - just apply those fixes and set SunPost411FCSLd to YES and 
OSTeenyVersion in mit/config/sun.cf to 3.

In fix-09:
|If you are running SunOS 4.1.1 and you apply Sun's ld patch 100170-6,
|then you will need to edit your site.def and add this line to the
|AfterVendorCF section:
|
|#define SunPost411FCSLd   YES

In fix-10:
|If you are running SunOS 4.1.2, change OSTeenyVersion in mit/config/sun.cf to
|have a value of 2.

In fix-11:
|Brief notes on what this patch fixes:
|
|config: make on SunOS 4.1.2 fails unless tree previously built in

Almost all window managers (twm, mwm, olwm and their derivates) support
escape sequences for it. For your purpose put following into your
.login (if you're using csh or tcsh), for sh you have to modify it.

if ( "$term" == "xterm" ) then
	echo "^[]2;${LOGNAME}@${HOST}^G^[]1;${HOST}^G"
endif

Note, ^[ stands for <Esc>, in vi you can enter it by pressing
Ctrl-V and the <Esc>. Same for ^G, it means Ctrl-G. In vi:
press Ctrl-V and then Ctrl-G.
The first sequence puts the string into the title bar the second
in the icon.

BTW, you can also put the current working directory in the
title bar if you make an alias for cd:

alias cd 'cd \!* ; echo "^[]2;${LOGNAME}@${HOST}: ${cwd}^G"'

greetings,
Thomas

Hi

I am trying to implement a pointer feature in Xlib

I have multiple windows and all can take input and 
show output simultaneously on all other displays

I want to implement a pointer feature 

I would like to get the pointer to come up on all windows once 
I choose pointer in the menu and every one should be able
to see it

Can you give me some hints as to how I should proceed 


replies will be greatly appreciated

Thank you

This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to
do with this.

Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as
X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS
and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.

That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display
on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port
which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say
you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could
put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.
You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to
mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could
have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,
or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any
combination.

Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use
of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different
in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.

The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12
screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server
that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,
MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek,
this is 12.

As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e.
X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X
I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is
not the case.

We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of
course, I could say "Buy all you want, we'll support more."

The subject does not describe the problem I am having very well.  Please read
on...

I am trying to write a function which creates an XtAppContext and a Widget,
displays the widget for a while, then destroys everything and returns.  The
problem is that multiple calls to this function cause a variety of problems
including (depending on which calls I make to get rid of things):

- Core Dump
- BadPixmap X Error
- Widget not unmapped


Here is a simple (C++) program I wrote to show the problem:

#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <Xm/Xm.h>
#include <Xm/PushB.h>

void bla()
{
        XtAppContext app;
        Display *dis = XOpenDisplay("");
        int junk = 0;

        Widget top=XtAppInitialize (&app, "test", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,
                NULL, NULL, 0);

        Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget("blaaa", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,
                        top,
                        XmNheight, 50,
                        XmNwidth, 50,
                        NULL);

        XtRealizeWidget(top);
        //Same as XtAppMainLoop but with only 10 XEvents
        for (int i=0;i<=10;i++)
        {
                XEvent event;
                XtAppNextEvent(app, &event);
                XtDispatchEvent(&event);
        }

// WHAT SHOULD I PUT HERE???
        XtUnrealizeWidget(top);
        XtDestroyWidget(top);
        XtDestroyApplicationContext(app);
        XCloseDisplay(dis);
// ???
}

main()
{
        for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)
                bla();
}

Note that I rewrote XtAppMainLoop so that at a given time (in this example,
after 10 XEvents) the function will exit and return to the main program.
With this example, I get the following error on about (this is NOT consistent)
the 5th call to bla():

X Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC)
  Resource id in failed request:  0xe0000d
  Serial number of failed request:  71
  Current serial number in output stream:  86

If I take out the XtUnrealizeWidget(top); line, it just dumps core on the
seconds call.

Furthermore, every time I call XtAppInitialize() (other than the 1st time), I
get:

Warning: Initializing Resource Lists twice
Warning: Initializing Translation manager twice.


So finally, my question is this:

What needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates
an XtAppContext and widgets multiple times?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

PLEASE respond via email as I dont usually have time to read this group.

Thanks very much.

I'd like to compile X11r5 on a Sony NWS-1750 running NEWS 4.1c.  The
X distribution has support for this config, and the release notes say
it has been tested on the machine.  BUT, also in the release notes,
nothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers.  What am I
supposed to use for my r5 X server then?  How can the OS be supported,
but not the hardware? Is there something in the r4 binaries that can
be used as the r5 server? These may seem like silly questions, but
I'm *really* confused.

Here's what I (think) have figured out.  All I need to do is install
the R5 disitribution without the Xserver like the sony.cf file defines,
and all the new libraries, utils, etc., will be installed and my old
server from r4 will still work.  This will allow me to run Xview 3.0,
and have X11r5 up and running.  Does the server interface remain the
same with all changes made only to the libs?

Another question: Is it likely that since Sun is dropping OW support
that the desktop utils (like the file manager) will be made public?
It would be nice if companies would make old code public for the
benefit of those of us with smaller budgets. :)

Forgive me if this is a FAQ (I have checked the list but I cant find it).

I have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO (not grayscale monitors)
The problem is that when I have an character application that displays input
fields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the
input field.

The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather
than a block, but how do you do this. I can't find any means although
various sources seem to indicate it can be done.

When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block.
This would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the
default either.

Configuration is  : Motorola 88K X11R4

Please reply by email if poss.

Thank you

Now available: xvertext 4.0 
--------------

Summary                                  
-------
xvertext provides you with four functions to draw strings at any angle in   
an X window (previous versions were limited to vertical text). Rotation  
is still achieved using XImages, but the notion of rotating a whole font
first has been dropped.

What's new?
-----------
I've added a cache which keeps a copy of previously rotated strings - thus
speeding up redraws.

Where can I get it?

Hello world,

I want to write my Xt-application code like this:

{
    do_some_work();
    /* now I need some user input */
    XmCreateDialog();
    wait_for_user_input(input);
    if (input == "OK") {
       more_work();
    } else {
       other_work();
    }
}

So "more_work() and other_work()" are not in callback functions but the
application simply waits for the user to answer the question.

How can I code this in my Xt/Motif-application?

Thanks very much in advance.

Greetings, Huub.

What sort of traffic is generated with the X-calls?  I am curious to find
out the required bandwidth that a link must have  if one machine running
DV/X is supporting multiple users (clients) and we require adequate response
time.  Anyone have any ideas ??

A couple of weeks ago, I was asking for a public domain schematic editor
which is compatible with SPICE and runs under X.

I got several e-mails and therefore I wrote this summary:

It seems that there are two public domain tools available.

The first one is called 'chipmunk' and is available at  
hobiecat.caltech.edu or
in europe at ifi.uio.no. In fact chipmunk is complete VLSI design tool 
(schematic editor, layout editor, LVS, DRC...). The schematic editor  
itself is
called LOG.

The second one I heard of is called 'OCTTOOLS'. It is also a complete VLSI
package. The fully uncompressed release takes about 130Mb of disk space.  
It
should be available at Berkley.

That's all I got so far.

Mark

I had no possibility to join the

               7th annual X Technical Conference 
               January 18-20 1993
               Boston, MA

Nevertheless, I'm interested in information about the tutorials,
exspecially about 

               Tutorial ID:  A-SECURITY
               Title: A Survey of X and Security

               Tutorial ID:  F-ADMIN
               Title: X and the Administrator

Does anybody know, where I can get information (paper/mail) about these ?

Has anybody information about  Kerberos  (escpecially in connection with 
X Display Manager xdm)?

Thanks,

Does USL SVR4 support LD_RUN_PATH a la Solaris 2?
Or an equivalent?

If so, you can put the library in a package specific lib directory,
compile the app with LD_RUN_PATH defined, and all should work.

Besides, I'd say name it libPACKAGExcl.a if possible.

Hi Folks.

As part of my self-introduction to X I've been trying to do some simple
icon animation (sort of like icondoit from mswindows).  Changing your
own applications icon is fairly simple:  If you have a widget ID you can
just XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap (or whatever) and you're done. Alternately
you can set window manager hints.  These methods don't seem to work with
icons which your application doesn't specifically own.

In my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in 
my icon box so my question is:  Given a window-id, how do you change the
icon pixure ?  A working example would be very much appreciated.  If it makes
any difference, I'm using motif 1.1 on VMS T6.0-5KE.

Thanks -
Scott :)

Contents:Problems with table widgets in R5

	The following part of a program (an user interface for a simulation
	system) did work in R4, but refused to in R5. Of cause, the R4-version
	did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass 			instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition 			(formerly XtTblPosition).
	Since compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error
	(on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the
	model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText 
	widgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of 			zero. 
	Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the 			width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup 		or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on 			whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource 			file or not).
	
	Question: Does anyone know, why XtQueryGeometry returns so low prefered
			values when working on table widgets or perhaps what
			to do about?

	I'll be happy, if someone is able to help me. 
	Germans are requested to answer in german.

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains
Xlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item
to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() 
(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care
of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the
Window is mapped.

The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window
is visible and mapped.  Do you know the best way to "tickle" a window so
that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item?

Use a GC with the subwindow_mode attribute set to IncludeInferiors. The
default is ClipByChildren. However, beware if any of the children are of
a different depth to the parent; the semantics of this are undefined by the
protocol.

I want to do the equivalent of an "xwininfo -name" via a call or set of calls
in Xlib.  I need to map a windows name to its id.
It's probably easy, but I've only been programming in X for a little while.
I've looked in the O'reilly books and didn't find it and I also checked the
FAQ and couldn't find it.

Email to one of the following addresses and I'll post a response if it
seems reasonable to do so.

In plain Motify using a dialog 'in-line' like this simply isn't done. You need
to set callbacks from the buttons/widgets in your dialog and let the callback routines
do the work. In the callbacks you can then carry on the flow of logic. 

XView from Sun actually supports this very neatly with a 'Notify' box, which can
return a status in-line, it does actualy ease coding but goes against the event
driven style of an application.

Summary: Redesign required.

If you're willing to do a little work, you can make DrawnButtons do what you
want, more-or-less. One of my colleagues here at GE CRD has done just that
in our internal LYMB system.

We have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of
dial positions from a single set of vectors. Each set of vectors is then
drawn into a pixmap. Clicking the button advances the knob's state and
changes to the next pixmap in the sequence.

Using DrawnButtons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular
portion of the parent widget, but that's normally not a big shortcoming. You
can make things look circular enough.

You've got to set border_pixel in your window attributes. The default
is CopyFromParent which gives the BadMatch. Do this:

   ...
   unsigned long valuemask;
   ...
   /*
    * if border_width is non-zero you'd better alloc a colour from cmap
    * rather than use any old pixel value. Also, use valuemask, it makes

    */
   attr.colormap = cmap;
   attr.border_pixel = 0;
   valuemask = CWColormap | CWBorderPixel;
   win = XCreateWindow(
           dpy,
           DefaultRootWindow(dpy),
           10,10,
           width,height,
           0,		         /* border width. see comment below */
           8,                    /* depth */
           InputOutput,          /* class */
           vinfo.visual,         /* visual */
           valuemask,
           &attr
         );

A note on border_width: your code looked like this:

>>   win = XCreateWindow(
>>           dpy,
>>           DefaultRootWindow(dpy),
>>           10,10,
>>           width,height,
>>           CopyFromParent,       /* border width */
>>           8,                    /* depth */
>>           InputOutput,          /* class */
>>           vinfo.visual,         /* visual */
>>           CWColormap,
>>           &attr
>>         );

border_width set to CopyFromParent works but doesn't make sense.
border_width should be an unsigned int. You get away with it because
CopyFromParent is #define'ed to be zero in X.h. If it happened to be
defined as -1 you'd get a very interesting looking window!

Another company, Congruent Corporation of New York City, has also ported Xlib
Xt and Motif 1.1 over to MS Windows NT, which provides full client development
for X applications in an NT environment.

If you are porting InterViews over to MS Windows, I thought InterViews was
a C++ toolkit with C++ classes. If that is so, how can it be built on Xlib,
unless the classes are calling Xlib functions?

1) This is NOT a feature of the Window Manager but of xterm.
2) This sequences are NOT ANSI compatible, are they ?
   Does anyone know IF there are compatible sequences for this and what they
   are ? I would think they are DCS (device control sequence) introduced,
   but may be a CSI sequence exists, too ?
   This MUST work on a dxterm (VT and ANSI compatible), it may not work
   on xterms.

The short answer seems to be: "I don't".
The particular package (wscrawl) seems to reset *all* its defaults
if *any* of them are missing from the .Xdefaults file.  Once I added
the missing ones to the .Xdefaults file, the problem goes away.

Dear Xperts,

I've trawled through the cc and ld man pages for an explanation on apparentlly
frequently used compiler options with X programs (Ultrix V4.3/DEC 5000). However
   ,
the criptic information I found largely overestimates my brain potential and up
till now I haven't got the slightest idea what the following options are standin
   g
for and when to use them (I gathered them from different X programs):

        1) -Wc,-Nd4000 -Wc,-Ns4000 -Wc,-Nt50000  -Wf,-XNg1000

        2) -Nf,-XNh2000 -Olimit 2000

        3) Also, has anybody the foggiest idea what the following link error mea
   ns
           and what corrective action should be taken? I know of bss as the area
    in

Dear Xperts:

  I want to place a specific group of icons in an icon box and
have my other icons appear outside of the box.  Does anyone
know if there's a way I can do this??  I'm using X11R5 and
Motif 1.2.1.

Thanks!

Can someone recommend an inexpensive 19" monochrome X station, that
is not PC software emulation based? Please tell me manufacturer,
model, price and any other significant specs. Thanks.

It seems like XTranslateCoord. doesn't work the way I expecting it.  Right
after performs a XMoveWindow, I want to know the absolute window position
with respect to the root window.  To get this info. I do a XTranslateCoordinates
but the abs_x, and abs_y aren't right?  Does anybody know of a way to find 
out this information?

Thanks, please e-mail to hsteve@carina.unm.edu if it's possible

Many X servers supporting graphics accelerators do not allow the creation
of pixmaps exeeding the size of the screen.  One workaround is to create
several smaller pixmaps and add the results.

How much support do you need?  I don't think there's anything
that prohibits you from implementing such a widget, though you
will have to write your own versions of the functions that draw
the 3D shadow and traversal highlighting.

I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network
itself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have
roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell
file servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our
Ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each
segment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run
were very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.

But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486
33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have
10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns
because you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will
attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time
slice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.

Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding
in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of
thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before
you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).
It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going
to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all
doing network things also...)

Hi netters,

I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric
field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field.
In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters,
in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by 
PANEL_MAX_VALUE! 

As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls
number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't
work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h>
contains the following bit:

	/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,
	 * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes
	 */
	PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,			 152),
	PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,		 182),

which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.
But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting
this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and return value 0.

Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me,
and clear this problem?

Any help is very much appreciated.

Yuri

For some reason the following code causes my X application to beep whenever I
intercept a keystroke and change it's meaning.  The intent of this code it to
allow "date" fields the following special keys:

	[Tt]:	Insert today's date
	[+=]:	Bump day up by one
	[-_]:	Bump day down by one

I hardcoded some dates for this example.  Perhaps I shouldn't be using an
XmText field for this.

Is this an advantage to MS Windows or to Xt?  I used to think it

Is there aything available for X similar to QuicKeys for the Macintosh --
something that will allow me to store and playback sequences of keystrokes,
menu selections, and mouse actions - directing them towards another
application?

If so, could someone send me information on its availability -- and if not,
how hard do we think it might be to send input to other X applications and,
hopefully, deal with their responses appropriately?  (If an application is
going to take a few seconds to process I probably have to wait  for it to
complete before sending another command.)

thanks,

david,

(2nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered)

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains
Xlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item
to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() 
(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles
"regular" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care
of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a "proper" way
to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is
guaranteed to be mapped.

The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window
is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow "tickle" the
Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable
it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.

What is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior?

Dear Xperts,

I've trawled through the cc and ld man pages for an explanation on apparentlly
frequently used compiler options with X programs (Ultrix V4.3/DEC 5000). However
   ,
the criptic information I found largely overestimates my brain potential and up
till now I haven't got the slightest idea what the following options are standin
   g
for and when to use them (I gathered them from different X programs):

        1) -Wc,-Nd4000 -Wc,-Ns4000 -Wc,-Nt50000  -Wf,-XNg1000

        2) -Nf,-XNh2000 -Olimit 2000

        3) Also, has anybody the foggiest idea what the following link error mea
   ns
           and what corrective action should be taken? I know of bss as the area
    in
           UNIX for uninitialized data, but I'm completely unaware of the gp are
   a.

"colormapInds: a large common placed in gp area because of a small undefined
 reference (possible gp relocation errors may result)
 pixelMap: a large common placed in gp area because of a small undefined
 reference (possible gp relocation errors may result)
 ld:
 gp relocation out-of-range errors have occured and bad object file produced
 (corrective action must be taken)
 gp relocation out-of-range for small data or bss by,
        221181 in the positive direction,
        0 in the negative direction.
 Best -G num value to compile all -count'ed objects creating nmr with is 13
 Best -G num value calculation reliable only if all -count'ed objects were
 compiled with -G num greater or equal to maximum size of a literal pool
 item (8).
 *** Error code 1"

        4) Finally, is the options syntax consistent across different vendor's
compilers. If not, does imake offers a standard machine independent approach to
it?

I do realize that an explanation will involve some compiler and OS knowledge but
I pretty know some basics and help of any nature will be greatly appreciated.

I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band
boxes in Motif/X.  I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a
colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines
in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using
XPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay
around when the window is refreshed.

Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with:

   /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */
   /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */
   palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;
   palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;
   palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;
   XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);
   XFlush( myDisplay);

   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);
   XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);

Then to draw I do:

   XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);
   XFlush( myDisplay);

And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do:

   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);


What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of
whatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If
the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are
over a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxor
function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases and
redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).

Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong?

If your Expose event handler is truly intelligent about exposed
rectangle information, then you can use XClearArea to generate an
Expose event (assuming that your background pixel is not None) for the
enclosing rectangle of your new item.

This is still not great, since any other items contained within that
rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn.

If your Expose event handler simply redraws everything, you'll be
doing much more work than just drawing the new item "on top" of the
existing scene.

Hi, 

has anybody implements an RPC server in the HP Xwindows? In SUN Xview, there
is a notify_enable_rpc_svc() call that automatically executes the rpc processes
when it detects an incoming request. I wonder if there is a similar function in
HP X/motif that perform the same function.

any help is appreciated.

I am developing an X (Xt,Xm) application that will include a graphics window
of some sort with moving symbols among other things.  A pure X application
could be implemented with Motif widgets, one of which would be an 
XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib.  But I would like to take advantage of
the Graphics Library (GL) available on our IBM RS/6000 (SGI's GL i believe).

Is it possible to mix X and GL in one application program?
Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me
with XOpenWindow?

I have never used GL before, but the doc on GL winopen() says that the first
time winopen() is called it opens a connection to the server.   Also, most of
the GL calls do not require a Display or GC, unlike most X calls.  From this
initial information it appears that X and GL cannot be mixed easily.   Is this
true?

Does PEX (graPHIGS?) have the same functionality of GL?


Environment:
     AIXwindows X11R4
     Motif 1.1
     GL is available
     AIX Sys V 3.2
     IBM RS/6000 360

I am looking for software to draw a graph.  I want to just give it a list

reasonable positioning of it.

Hmmm.... Clearly?  Depends on your programming model.  It is not at all
forbidden to draw outside the context of an expose event.  Certainly any
internal data structures should be maintained such that the visual
appearance would be maintained properly whenever an expose event happens
to be generated.  This doesn't preclude drawing immediately after
updating the datastructures though...

Hi, Experts, 

I'm kind of new to X. The following question is strange to me. I am
trying to modify the contents of the colormap but failed without
reason (to me). I am using the following piece of code:


  toplevel = XtInitialize(argv[0], "Testcolor", NULL, 0,
			  &argc, argv);
  dpy = XtDisplay(toplevel);
  scr = DefaultScreen(dpy);
  def_colormap = DefaultColormap(dpy,scr);

  if(XAllocColorCells(dpy, def_colormap, True, NULL, 0, cells, 5)) {
    color.pixel = cells[0];
    color.red = 250;
    color.green = 125;
    color.blue = 0;
    color.flags = DoRed | DoGreen | DoBlue;
    XStoreColor(dpy, def_colormap, &color);
    printf("\n Try to allocate, the color %d as (%d,%d,%d)",
	   color.pixel, color.red, color.green, color.blue); 

    XQueryColor(dpy, def_colormap, &color);
    printf("\n After  allocate, the color %d is (%d,%d,%d)",
	   color.pixel, color.red, color.green, color.blue); 
  }
  else
    printf("\n Error: couldn't allocate color cells");


Running output:

     Try to allocate, the color 7 as (250,125,0)
     After  allocate, the color 7 is (0,0,0)

After XStoreColor(), XQueryColor() just returned the original value. 
No failure/error displayed but the contents of colormap are obvious
unchanged. (I also tried to draw a line using the colors but it 
turned out to be the unmodified colors.)

So what is my problem? How to modify the contents of the colormap?

Any help/information will be appreciated. Please send mail to
"yang@cs.umass.edu".

I expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and, when the new application starts up, it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap.
It therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors.  This makes it look
ugly until it's window gets priority.  Then Macx changes the colormap so that
the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted, but now other applications
are having to make do with it's colormap.

This is a problem with all color X servers (or at least all color Xservers I have
seen) when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap.
My solution is usually to (1) avoid colormap-greedy apps and (2) display
applications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather
than in color (if this is an option for the application).

	Hi. I'm trying to figure out how to make a window manager
place the window where the create window command tells it,
regardless of what it may think is right. (my application has
reason to know better)

	I don't want to set the override-redirect because I do
want all the embellishments that the window manager gives, I just
want the wm to accept my choice of location.

	I've tried twm, tvtwm and mwm and they are all
uncooperative.

	Thanks,
	-- Ethan

From the XmTextField man page (during discussion of resources):

   XmNverifyBell

      Specifies whether a bell will sound when an action is reversed
      during a verification callback.

You are setting doit to false in the callback, and Text[Field] is beeping
as it should.  To turn off this behavior, set this boolean resource to false.

If I understand your problem correctly, you want to have a way to send
exposures to your manager widget when your app-specific code draws xlib
graphics on the window.

It sounds like you might want to send an exposure using
XSendEvent and specifying a region. If you know the region you need to
send the exposure, generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects,
you can use XCreateRegion to create a region, XUnionRectWithRegion to add the
new object polygons to the region, and then either use the region
to clip your GC for the redraw or use XRectInRegion to test which of your
other objects need to be redrawn. Keeping in mind that the stacking order
of overlapping objects affects how they look.

Hope it helps

What does this have to do with my original question???  I previously
stated that I did an XCopyArea of the depth-8 pixmap to the screen
just to make sure that my image had data, and it did.  This is NOT
a problem with expose events, it has to do with XCopyPlane not
working!!!

Does anyone have a code fragment they could send demonstrating that
XCopyPlane works???  This would be very helpful!

Thanks!

Is there a version of Wcl that has been ported to Solaris 2, including
ANSI C? I had numerous problems trying to compile Wcl under Solaris, 
and the functions do not have prototypes.  

I have Wcl 2.01 from the Sun User Group's 1992 CDs.

Please email answers as I am not on this list.

Do you have the X source code?  Simply look in mit/clients/xwininfo/xwininfo.c and you

I specifically made the above comment assuming that perhaps the code fragment
came from a simple "open-draw-quit" client.  

As per your question: why not have the button handler add the object, and
then call the "window_redraw()" (or whatever) directly?  Although, depending
on how the overall application is structured, there may be no problem with
rendering the object directly in response to the button press.

   Environment:
      mach/arch : sparc/sun4  (IPX)
      OS	: SunOS 4.1.3
      X11	: X11R5 (patchlevel 22)
      Motif	: 1.2.2

I bring up X server using 'startx' and /usr/bin/X11/Xsun. The following sequence
of actions crashes the X server (SIGPIPE, errno=32, 'xinit' reports that connexion 
to X server lost):

   1. xinit -- Xsun
   2. start mwm
   3. start a client with a 100dpi/75dpi font.
   4. move the window by dragging the title bar.

The server dumps core due to SIGPIPE. One of the two messages is printed:

  "Connection to X server lost"

or
  
  "Connection broken (errno=32)"

(I believe the first is reported by a client and the second by the server itself).

Next, I ran xdm in debug level = 5. After the same set of actions, xdm reports:

  select returns -1
  Server for :0 terminated unexpectedly: status 2560


Note:
 * The problem doesn't occur with other window managers (twm or olwm). 
 * I have not set LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
 * I am not running font server. 
 * If I start the client with fixed width font, I do not see this problem.
 * My font path:
     /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi

   (I did mkfontdir in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi, /usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi,
   /usr/lib/X11/fonts/PEX, /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo,
   and in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc).

 * This problem seems to occur only on IPX machines. I do not see this 
   problem on IPC workstations.

Questions:
 * What the hell is goin on ? :-)
 * What does "status 2560" mean (of the server).

I'd greatly appreciate any hints as to the cause of the problem.

I found an oddity with our SGI Indigo (MIPS R3000 chip).
When xlock +nolock is running, and I am working remotely
or in batch (at) mode, the runtime of my programs (as timed
by using clock() in the code itself) is ~25% slower than if
xlock is NOT running.  No other processes seem to affect my
runtimes, yet this is very consistent!

Any explanations, real or imagined :)

In example 3.5, page 76 : "Creating a pop-up dialog box"

The application creates window with a button "Quit" and "Press me".
The button "Press me" pops up a dialog box. The strange feature of
this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the
first time. If I try to pop it up a 2nd time (3rd, 4th .... time), 
it is *much* slower.

Has anyone any experience with these sample programs, or why I get
this behaviour - fast response time for the first time but slow response
time from 2nd time onwards ?
Anyone can give me some ideas on how to program popups so that each time
they popup in reasonable fast response time ?

Glad to hear that it's working for you!

I couldn't find it on "export".  However, Simon Leinen
<simon@liasun6.epfl.ch> has added an Imakefile and an Athena
version, and made it available for FTP in the file
liasun3.epfl.ch:/pub/X/contrib/xrpc.tar.z.  (Note the ".z"
suffix; you'll need GNU gzip -- also on liasun3 in /pub/gnu --
to uncompress it.)  

If this doesn't work, send me a note and I'd be happy to mail you
a copy; but you probably won't get it until the start of May --
I'm on holidays as of tomorrow! :-)

I believe for this to work on a color display you must set the foreground of
the GC to be (foreground^background).

I have a problem where an Athena strip chart widget is not calling it's
get value function.  I am pretty sure this is happening because I am
not using XtAppMainLoop, but am dealing with events via sockets.  (ya ya).

Anyway, I want to cause a timeout so that the strip chart widget(s) will
call their get value callback.  Or if someone knows another FAST way around
this (or any way for that matter) let me know.  I cannot (or I don't think)
call the XtNgetValue callback myself because I don't have the value for
the third parameter of the get value proc (XtPointer call_data).  

In other words, I want to force a strip chart widget to update itself.

Any ideas anyone?

I need to write an application which does annotation notes
on existing documents.  The annotation could be done several
times by different people.  The idea is something like having
several acetate transparencies stacked on top of each other
so that the user can see through all of them.  I've seen
something like this being done by the oclock client.
Could someone please tell me how to do it in Xt?
Thank you very much.

	window = XCreateWindow(...);
	XSetTransientForHint(display, window, window);
	XMapWindow(...);

This is probably cheating, and some window managers might STILL refuse to 
give it a border and all that other stuff, but it usually works.

 We've developed a number of applications using DevGuide and found it to 
be a very useful tool. I've been impressed with the level of integration it
affords using the connection editor. I love the general ease of use.
 
 I talked with Tali Aben at Sun today about DevGuide + Motif. She was very
helpful. We provided some input as to what we'd like to see in the next
version of DevGuide. Tali was very enthusiatic about our comments. I mentioned
I was going to post this email message and she offered to receive additional
comments from the net on what DevGuide should evolve into. 
 
 Send your comments/wish-list, raving, et. al. about DevGuide to:

  Tali.Aben@Sun.COM


 Pretty cool example of a company that cares what we want.... More of this
and computers may have a future.

 Frankly, I like the idea that it will offer some migration capability
to DOE/DOMF through an integrated ToolTalk capability, pointed out in March's 
SunExpert magazine. 

 Technology works, we can crankout the interfaces with DevGuide. Price is 
outstanding.

Help!

I'm trying to run dxterm's (DECs' xterm) on a DECstation 5000/240
(Ultrix 4.3, X11R4, Motif 1.1.3) with the DISPLAY variable set to an
Apollo DN2500 (Domain/OS 10.3, X11R4, Motif ?.?).

I get these errors appearing on the DECstation:

> dxterm
X Toolkit Warning: Cannot convert string "<Key>apCharDel        " to type VirtualBinding
X Toolkit Warning: Cannot convert string "<Key>apCopy   " to type VirtualBinding
X Toolkit Warning: Cannot convert string "<Key>apCut    " to type VirtualBinding

X Toolkit Warning: Cannot convert string "<Key>apRightBar       " to type VirtualBinding
X Toolkit Warning: Cannot convert string "<Key>apLeftBar        " to type VirtualBinding
Segmentation fault
>

Any ideas? Is it a Motif problem...are the DEC and Apollo versions of Motif
incompatible? Or something to do with XKeysymDB?

(xterms run fine on DEC displaying on Apollo..arggh)

I need to run dxterm because the package we are using on the DEC's, Oracle Case,
uses dxterm by default, and we have a lab of Apollo workstations we would like
to run Oracle from.

Okay, I looked through the FAQs and didn't see this, but I know its
come up before...

XAllocColor is supposed to do the following in order:
    Try to find an exact match read-only color cell. (within hardware limits)
    Try to allocate a read-only colorcell and set it to match.
	and when all else fails, 
    Return the colorcell with the best match from the read-only colors 
    already allocated in the colormap.

This sounds good in theory.  It doesn't seem to work this way
though.  If there is no exact match already in the colormap, and 
no unallocated cells, then XAllocColor fails, even when it has 
already allocated several other cells already, and there are dozens 
of read-only cells already in the colormap.

Is this a bug?  A feature?  A misunderstanding on my part?

Any help appreciated,

This design will work but I don't think it can take easily take advantage
of expose event redraw optimization; that is, the whole window will be
redrawn, not just the area with the new item.

Does anyone know where these missing functions are located? If you do can you
help me with it?

I posted before to one of the other Unix groups, I tried their suggestions but
always get this error.

If you have to know: I am using Unix system V. The machines here are 486's. The
terminals I want to use are separate and just called X-terminals and they seem
dedicated to that. I'm not sure as to what they really are, since it is one of
my first times out with this X-windows gidget! That is, first time programming
for it, so to speak. I use them alot just for the graphics things.

If you can help, mail me soon.

The shell is waiting for the window-manager to respond to its
positioning request.  The window-manager is not responding because
it thinks the window is already in the right place.

Exactly *why* the two components get into this sulk is unclear to
me; all information greatly received.

Does XDM work with DECnet? I have an Ultrix machine running both TCP/IP
and DECnet. I have a number of X-terminals hanging off the Ultrix host also
running TCP/IP and DECnet. Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure
on the X-terminals using TCP/IP. Since XDM is basically just an X-windows
client, shouldn't I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well?

My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client. It is making
TCP/IP specific socket calls. In this case the answer would be no; you can
not run XDM over DECnet. Is this right or not? Any feedback is appreciated.
Thanks.

Well, the first 2 are easy.  You need the math library.  Try adding -lm after
-lX11.  Don't know if that's the whole problem but it's a start.

CALL FOR VOTES: creation of comp.windows.suit

A Request For Discussion was posted on 26 Mar 1993, and both charter
and group name have been accepted.

Charter
=======

What is SUIT?
-------------

SUIT provides a standard library of screen components (buttons, menus,
sliders, etc.), and allows interactive layout and specification of user
interfaces.  The user interface to a SUIT program is editable even while
the application runs.  Programs using SUIT are written in ANSI-C.  SUIT
runs on UNIX/X, Color Macintosh, DOS, and Windows ; a single application
source file may be recompiled to run on all platforms.

SUIT was designed to be easy to learn - we view it as "the Pascal of UI
toolkits."  Learning from a 10-page written tutorial, our undergraduates
have been able to use SUIT productively after 2 hours.  This is possible
because we rely more heavily on interactive tools than previous toolkits,
and because the entire system as been designed to be easy to learn.

SUIT's biggest advantages are:
	- it runs across a very wide variety of hardware platforms
	- it has a documented 2 hour learning curve for beginners
	- it's very lightweight; relatively small amount of code

SUIT has now been distributed to thousands of sites, and has reached
all continents but Antarctica. It has also been used in graduate
courses at some universities, including Stanford.

The suit-users mailing list now has nearly 100 participants and has
message traffic of 10-15 per day. Some users have unsubcribed already,
citing the volume of mail as the main reason. We feel that this
justifies a newsgroup.

Details of the newsgroup
------------------------

comp.windows.suit will be an unmoderated forum that will handle all
aspects of SUIT, including:

	- questions about SUIT
	- bug reports
	- distribution of contributory code
	- announcement of new releases

Voting
------

Voting will begin when this CFV is posted, and will end on May 14, 1993
at 23:59 EST. In order for the group to be created, there must be a 2/3
majority of yes votes to no votes, and there must be 100 more yes votes
than no votes.

To vote yes, please send mail to:
	suit-yes@uvacs.cs.virginia.edu

To vote no, please send mail to:
	suit-no@uvacs.cs.virginia.edu

All votes will receive an acknowledgement. If there is a problem,
please DO NOT send mail to either of these addresses; send them to
the one below.

The subject field must be unambiguous; for example, "I vote for/against
comp.windows.suit" Conditional votes, which may receive an acknowledgement
initially, will be rejected. No anonymous votes will be accepted.
If you wish to change your vote, mail a new vote; only the most recent
vote by a user will be counted.

If you have problems, questions, or comments, please mail them to:
	suit-admin@uvacs.cs.virginia.edu
where we will attempt to respond as quickly as possible.

Over this period, two additional CFVs will be posted, along with
an acknowledgement of valid votes.

Thanks,

The SUIT Newsgroup Team

I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled
under Linux (SLS Release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some
problems.  Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question,
because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000.
	Basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes
set up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite
widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :

	typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)

but in several places in the HP source code, they reference the
insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just
one, as the prototype suggests.  For example:

	(*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)

Now, GCC chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments
are passed to the function.  So, does anyone have any suggestions as to
how to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the
code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h,
or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.
	Many thanks in advance for any help.

I recently compiled the X11R5pl22 sources using gcc-2.3.3 on
a Sun3/80. Everything seems to work fine. Usually. But at
seemingly random times the server will just hang. I will
click the mouse somewhere (never happens while my back is turned),
and without warning, it will freeze there, requiring the server
to be killed. Sometimes it will run fine for weeks, sometimes
only for minutes.

(Os: 4.1.1; frame buffer: bw2).

Has anyone seen this before, any ideas? (anything at all?)

thanks,

I've heard about that Italian guy distributing Motif binaries for 386BSD,
but I haven't heard of anybody doing the same thing for Linux.  ... and
I do follow the Linux news group pretty closely.  So, have I missed something?  I'd LOVE to get hold of Motif libs for Linux for $100!

I've just managed to get xdm running from an NCR 3000 (an SVR4 486 box
running XFree86 1.2) to my NCD XDisplay.  It's pretty much working, but
I'm encountering a weird error.  I'm attempting to start an xterm from
my .xsession file, but nothing happens.  Redirecting stderr to a file
using 'exec 2>$HOME/.xerrors' in .xsession reveals the error message:

  "xterm: Error 14, errno 1: Not owner"

Now, if I start xterm from the window manager, or from the command line,
it works fine.  And starting other clients, like the window manager (mwm),
and a clock, from my .xsession also works.

Anyone encountered this?  Suggestions?

I had this problem as well - It had to do with the CG6 graphics card that
comes with the IPX.  What fixed the problem for me was to apply the "sunGX.uu"
that was part of Patch #7.  Patch #1 also used this file so perhaps you
didn't apply the one that came with Patch #7.

    You can get the ApplicationContext associated with a widget by calling
    XtWidgetToApplicationContext.

You are setting doit to false in the callback, and Text[Field] is beeping

Anyone know how an application can retrieve the name of the font from
an application given an XFontStruct *? 
Would XGetFontProperty work if I passed XA_FONT_NAME? 
anyone know details of this?  Thanks in advance.

Unless you run `xlock -mode blank`, xlock consumes CPU time generating
the nice animated display. The code you are running is competing with
xlock for the CPU. If you run top (via a remote login), you can really
see what is going on.

Are we talking about an xterm which would accept the same escape sequences
as that for VT340 (or colour decterm/dxterm)? I thought that was called
colxterm (and my testing of it shows some oddities that might be bugs or
might be my program going wrong).

I'm also unsure of what is meant by "ansi mouse xterm"!

I am having a problem with the high order bit of a character being 
clipped when entered in an xterm window under motif. I have reprogrammed
the F1 key to transmit a <ff> <be> character sequence by using the
following line in .Xdefaults:

~Ctrl ~Shift ~Alt <Key> F1 : string(0xff) string(0xbe) \n\

I merge in this line with xrdb -merge and then create the new xterm
which has the remapped F1 key. The problem that arises is that the 
application which is recieving input at the time only sees a <7f> <3e>
sequence, which is <ff> <be> with the high order bit of each
character being filtered or ignored.

When I run xev and press the F1 key, I get the correct value showing 
up in the following two key events:

  KeyPress event, serial 14, synthetic NO, window 0x2800001,
  root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815294, (67,80), root:(74,104),
  state 0x0, keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe, F1), same_screen YES,
  XLookupString gives 0 characters:  ""

  KeyRelease event, serial 16, synthetic NO, window 0x2800001,
  root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815406, (67,80), root:(74,104),
  state 0x0, keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe, F1), same_screen YES,
  XLookupString gives 0 characters:  ""

Notice that the keysym being transmitted is correct; 0xffbe.
But when I use the F1 key while in vi or in a program I wrote to 
spit back the hex values of keyboard input, I only get <7f> <3e>.

Does anyone know why the high order bit is being filtered and what
I can do to make sure that the entire 8bits make it through to
the final application? Any help is greatly appreciated.

Please *email* any responses.

  Yes, it's possible... in fact, there's some gl widget code in
/usr/lpp/GL somewhere... (it's named Glib.c; my IBM's down right now
though, so I can't find the exact location :)

  WARNING: this code feels quite bogus. It does things like calling
noport() before winopen(), and then extracting an X window id from it
anyway. It worked just fine under aix 3.1; I spent last weekend trying
to port it to 3.2 (gl under 3.2 doesn't seem to like it), and it's
turning into a Hard Job.

  Check out your "info" pages; it has some pretty good documentation on
whan you can and can't do when mixing gl and X, and how to go about
doing so.

Where did you hear this?  If it is printed in a book somewhere,
throw away the book.  According to the MIT specs, only the first
2 are true.

How can I get the font family, weight and slant from an
instance of a widget? Using initFontContext(), getNextFont()
and freeFontContext() I can get the size of the font (and a
bunch of other stuff concerning the font) but nowhere have
I found family, weight and slant. Assume that I do not have
access to the source where family, weight and slant were
orginaly used when creating a fontlist.

The oclock widget was written using the SHAPE extension.
You can do the same in your widgets.  Few current widgets
support SHAPE, so you'll have to subclass them to add that
functionality.

There is a widget already defined for GL.  It is the GlxMDraw (motif) or
GlxDraw (athena) widget.  It is similar to a XmDrawingArea, except that it
allows you to use GL calls to render into the window.  Look at glxlink,
glxunlink, glxgetconfig, and glxwinset in the man pages.

The GlxMDraw widget works pretty well.  OpenGL will be an improvement.

I think GL is a little easier to use and a little more powerful, but
that's just an opinion.  Mileage may vary.

To incrementally update the contents of windows, I use the following trick:

	1. Set the window background to None,
	2. Call XClearArea(display, window, 0, 0, 0, 0, True),
	3. Restore the window background to its correct value.

The call to XClearArea does not repaint the window background, but still
generates exposure events for visible parts of the window.

In order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled
incrementally (something is already displayed on the screen and may need to
be erased), I encapsulate the 3 operations with 2 self addressed client
messages, which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server.

XGrabServer(display)
client message (start-incremental)
 	background None
	XClearArea
	Restore background 
client message (end-incremental)
XUngrabServer(display)

The GrabServer prevents other events to be inserted by the server in the
critical section.

What it has to do with your original question is this: many times 
beginning X users (heck, experienced X users too!) write small test
programs.  Many times they forget to draw only in response to expose
events, and thus see unpreditable results whereby sometimes the application's
graphics show up, and sometimes they don't.  We're just trying to
eliminate all the "easy" explanations  for why you're not seeing your
graphics. 

That being said, why don't you try copying different planes to your
window other than 16 (== 1 << 4).  Try 1, 1<<1, 1<<2, ..., 1<<7
to see it you get any output.  Since you're dipslaying only a single 
plane of your data, it's possible that all the pixel values in your
pixmap have the same value for that color plane.

I think you are running Xapollo , it's a X11R3 server ...

If you want a X11R4 server you should install PSKQ3 (10.3.5) or 10.4
  so you can run Xdomain .

Hi,

  Please reply to me direct as I am not a member of this list.

  I am new to X, so please excuse my lax (read: "probably incorrect")
terminology!

  Environment: Sun Sparc 10, SunOs 4.1.3.  X11R5 path level 23.  My X process
is started by xdm.

  i) I want to setup the backgroud (root window?) of the tvtwm display to
     display the escherknot etc (grey is a very boring colour to work on)!

     The setup is as follows:

        lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0    -   xsetroot -bitmap ... etc
        ~user/.xsession         -   xsetroot .... etc
                                    tvtwm

     There are also .tvtwmrc and .Xdefaults files in the (~user) home
     directory.

     The xsetroot in Xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm
     login window as expected - very nice!

     Unfortunately, when the users session is started, the background of the
     tvtwm window reverts to grey.  If I manually type xsetroot... in an
     xterm window when the session has started, the background is changed as
     expected.

     The question is: How do I retain the background from the login window
     and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the
     the users session startup?

 ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised
     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.

     ie: real key       key shown on screen
         ------------   -------------------
         hash           back slash
         tilde          pipe
         double quote   at symbol
         pound          hash
         cursor key     not recognised

     This is very annoying!  Is X at fault here or the machine setup?  I have
     installed the xterm drivers that came with X11R5 in both terminfo and
     termcap as they seemed more uptodate.

     Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as
     expected!

  Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!

  Thanks,

Dave.

Okay, that's good.  I'm typing this from exactly the same setup.
(US-UNIX layout keyboard)  I did install the sunkbd patch, though.

Make sure you're using "ssetroot", which comes with tvtwm.  When tvtwm
starts up, it nukes the existing root window.  Use an "ssetroot" after
tvtwm starts up.   (You could spawn off a "(sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&")
You can also use "VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename" or just
VirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey.

Did you install the sunkbd patch?  It's in the contrib directory on export.
All the keys on my keyboard send events properly, except the following:
The End, PageUp, PageDown on the 6-key cluster aren't recognized.
Even the compose key works.  (Though I can't seem to get the composed
characters in an xterm to get passed.)

Anyone have a fix for the last two?

Dear SGI and netter GL-X Mixed-Model experts,
I am writing a mixed model application that creates a couple different
color maps for different windows, and I've been having trouble getting
the window manager to reliably honor my requests.  In some environments
(entry level R3000 Indigo w/ 4.0.5) all windows are getting properly
connected to their designated color maps, but on others (an IRIS 4D 240/GTX;
also a different entry level Indigo) the color mapping is unreliable
and changes behavior when I compile at different times.  The most common
problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according
to their colormap.  My application starts out by creating three top-level
windows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be
displayed by their colormap.  This is spectacularly aggravating.

I would dearly appreciate
  1. an explanation of the standard, RIGHT, CORRECT way to give a window
  a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it;

  2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my
  desired colormaps.

By now I have exhausted my own attempts on this, having tried everything
reasonable or imaginable.

Below is example code giving the schematic for how I have been *TRYING*
to do this.  Please, please, please SOMEBODY tell me what I am doing
wrong/how to do it right!!!


Yours,

Chris Lee

Hello Netlanders:

       I am a novice X user with a question for any Xgod.

       My computer configuration with the X problem is as follows:

       486DX50/256/16RAM  running Esix 4.0.4 
       Wangtek AT-style interface 250 M tape drive.
       I have loaded the Basic OS (which includes nsu) and
       inet utilities (tcp/ip).
       I ftp-ed the XFree86 (X11R5) binaries and installed properly.
 
 I can execute startx and run X-windows with no problems.
 However, if I try to access the tape drive while in X, the
 machine locks up instantly.  If I am out of X and access the
 tape, the tape drive works fine.  Soon as I try to
 startx again; the screen changes modes, but, the grey background
 pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked.  I have to login
 from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system.

 I've contacted Esix about this problem.  They claim THEIR X-window X11R4
 server (which I have) works with the Wangtek tape drive.  They also 
 claim I only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run X; I don't
 need inet (tcp/ip).  My experience has been that I need BOTH to get
 XFree86 to work.  I'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet
 packages to get X to work unless the inet package is causing my problem.

 I would like to get both X and my tape drive to co-exist on the same
 system.  If you can shed any light on the problem, it would be appreciated.
 
 One colleague implied this might be a hardware conflict.  If this is true,
 what direction should I look to resolve the conflict ?

 Thanks,

According to the OSF/Motif Style Guide, one should use cursor shapes to give
the user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him. So
a "hourglass" cursor should be shown when the application is busy, or a
"caution" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in
another. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level.
So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain
subpart of it, is a rather complicated matter. When cursors have been defined
for some windows, e.g. a "crosswire" cursor for a DrawingArea, things get even
more complicated. My intuition says that things should be easier, but is this
so? If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem, please let me
know. The topics on "busy cursors" in the several FAQ's are not helpful, since
they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window
attribute set to 'None'.

that the client is executing on.  I have access to the display string
but can I tell from the string?

If the client is executing on host foo then ":0", "unix:0", "foo:0",

"local:0" is also a valid display name (a shared memory connection
maybe?).  Are there other strings that I should check for?  Is there a
better way to detect this?

Thank you for any help you can give me.

Some time back I asked for software recommendations to  allow me to
run X from my PC at home to my Sparc at the office.

Many thanks for all replies, the majority of people  recommended
PCXremote from NCD. I received it yesterday  and installed it on
my Sparc and PC with only one hitch. 
The UNIX install consists of copying 2 files into some local bin directory. 
On the PC side, I ordered the WINDOWS version  which  came with a slick windows
installation.


The only problem I had was that  my .xinitrc  in my home directory
had the line
DISPLAY=`hostname`:0.0; export DISPLAY

s.t the clients I kicked off connected to my Xserver on the Sparc console.
By removing this line from the .xinitrc everything worked as planned
and the clients connected to the server at

`hostname`:1.0

Some comments on performance, I was connected to a Sparc 2 thru
a NetBlazer Terminal Server over a 9600 baud line.
My PC is a 486-DX2 ATI Ultra, 16 MB

Bitmap Stuff Sucked.
Basic Editing and compilation stuff definitely usable.
Xmail was very usable.

At times the first time U typed in an Xclient window there was
a very noticable delay, I put this down to brain damaged "WINDOWS
should not be called a SCHEDULER", besides that this will become
my remote work environment for a while.

Has anybody tried the NON Windows version of the product, the sales
person said they performed about the same, given the over head of
WINDOWS I question this?

many thanks for help to all who responded

I have a Sun 3/60 that has a mono framebuffer (bwtwo0 ?) built on the
motherboard.  The same system also has a cgfour (cgfour0 and bwtwo1 ?)
daughterboard.  I have been using this system with a color monitor having a
color "front" screen from the cgfour, and a mono "back" screen from the
bwtwo1, both on the same tube.  I recentley picked up a 1600 x 1280 Sun mono
monitor, and I would like to make a two headed system with the cgfour0 and the
bwtwo0.  I do not care if I loose the "back" screen on the color tube from the
bwtwo1.  After looking through the Xsun man page I am not sure if this is
possible.  Has anybody sucessfuly done this before?

The COSE announcement specifies that Motif will become the common
GUI. But what does this mean exactly? 

- Do they mean that all "COSE-complient" apps will have the Motif
  look and feel?

- Do they mean that all "COSE-complient" apps will use the Motif
  toolkit API?

- Do they mean both of the above?

- Is it possible that there will be a Motif-API complient toolkit with
  an OpenLook Look & Feel?

- How about an OLIT/XView/OI/Interviews API toolkit with a Motif L & F?
  (I know OI already does this, but will this be considered COSE-complient?)

- Will there be more than one "standard" toolkit API or L & F supported?

- How does using ToolTalk fit in with Motif?

This is my attempt to start a discussion in order to pull as much 
knowledge about these questions off the net... Feel free to e-mail
or followup.

The situation: running a Fortran executable that creats an Xterm.  An option
in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats
a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> while
the Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be "Tek-term") is
active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus
to the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the 
Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of
Xterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)  

The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.

Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics 
highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move 
the Tek-term to the top.  If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve 
screen space, it stays an icon.


The desired behavior: one of two options - 

    1. Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the 
       inactive one.

    2. Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated, it should revert to a icon
       but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher 
       level than the Xterm.

What I think I need: a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term will
be at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term.
These commands, would, I'd guess, need to be in the Fortran or in the 
command that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term.

Other information: All this is taking place on a VT-1300 (a DEC dumb 
X-windows terminal) connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif.

Thanks for your time.  If you've got any words of wisdom (other than 
"give up" ;-), please send email to

You can't make GL calls in an XmDrawingArea widget for sure.

I can vouch for that. The GL Widget works pretty well. I have been using it
for sometime now. I'm not sure though whether you can use Xlib calls to draw
into the GL widget. I haven't tried it yet nor have I read the accompanying
documentation completely. Try posting to comp.sys.sgi for more information.
Better still,you will find most of the answers in the  SGI manuals .. there
is a little transition guide which explains the "mixed-model programming"
paradigm(Mixing X and GL).

: |> Does PEX (graPHIGS?) have the same functionality of GL?

Well, PEX is designed as an extension to  X and will be more seamless  but 
then, it is buggy to start with .. opinions again.

  If you need speed, and your client can run on the same host as the X server,
  you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server (MIT-SHM).
  xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension. This is certainly
  available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS.
  A word of warning: make sure your kernel is configured to support shared
  memory. And another word of warning: OpenWindows is slower than the MIT
  server.
  I have written an imaging tool (using XView for the GUI, by the way) which
  yields over 10 frames per second for 512*512*8 bit images, running on a Sparc
  IPC (half the cpu grunt of an IPX). This has proved quite sufficient for
  animations.

1. You need these resources :

	XTerm*EightBitOutput:    true

2. In the shell you need to do :

Some one asked me recently why they when they used XQueryBestCursor to see
if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could, but the
server did not create cursors of that size. Investigation showed that some X
servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window, while
others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. The interesting thing
to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware -
a Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK, while a
Sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior on
NCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs. 
Actually, the NCD is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the root
winodw are gladly returned as OK. Is XQueryBestCursor semi-broken or is this
behavior correct? I'd really like to see a 2000x2000 cursor!

XDM is not just an X Window client.  XDM has its own protocol (XDMCP) that
operates of UCP on port 177.  It does provide a Login window which is an
X Window Client.  As to using DECnet protocol.  Looking through the source
for XDM from X11R5 that I have here, it seems that the bare bones code is
there but not completely there.

#
#My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client. It is making

From my look at the source, it seems you cannot run it over DECnet as shipped
with X11R5.

button (i.e. with the MB1 pressed). As XmNshowValue only displays
the current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding
image file name, I thought of using an XtAddEventHandler to do
the mapping between the scale value and the file name:

XtAddEventHandler(scaleImage,Button1MotionMask,  FALSE, SliderMoved, NULL);


and in the eventhandler do a:

  while (XCheckTypedWindowEvent (display, event->window, MotionNotify, &Return))
   ;
  XmScaleGetValue(scaleImage,&value);
  /*map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open*/


However, when I move the pointer in the scale widget I get callbacks, with of co
   urse
a null effect as my MB1 is not pressed to move the scale button. So what is goin
   g wrong?
Or is the a wrong approach to this problem?
Any hints are highly appreciated.

Can anyone help me?

I am having a problem displaying images greater than 32768 bytes from a
Decwindows program running on a Vax 6310, and displaying on a Sparc IPC
running Openwindows 3.0 and dni. The program works fine with Openwindows 2.0.

The code segment which fails is given below, the program simply crashes
out with an Xlib I/O error at the XPutImage() call.

	XImage          *ximage;
	ximage = XCreateImage(myDisplay, DefaultVisual(myDisplay, myScreen), 
			      ddepth, ZPixmap, 0, image,
			      xwid, ywid, 8, 0);
	XPutImage(myDisplay, myWindow, myGC,
		  ximage, 0, 0, xpos, ypos, xwid, ywid);

This isn't of much help! Especially when doing Phigs (PEX) via the libphigs as
supplied by MIT, I have much trouble together with PEX-terminals that don't
have enough memory!

Performing the following:

   visual.visualid = CopyFromParent;

   bg_pix = WhitePixel( grafik_display, DefaultScreen( grafik_display ) );
   
   xswa.backing_store      = NotUseful;
   xswa.event_mask         = ExposureMask | StructureNotifyMask;
   xswa.background_pixel   = bg_pix;

   graphic_window =
         XCreateWindow( graphic_display,
                       RootWindow( graphic_display,
                                  DefaultScreen( graphic_display ) ),
                       0,
                       0,
                       DisplayWidth(graphic_display, 
                                  DefaultScreen( graphic_display ) ),
                       DisplayHeight(graphic_display, 
                                  DefaultScreen( graphic_display ) ),
                       (unsigned int)0,
                       8,
                       InputOutput,
                       &visual,
                       CWEventMask | CWBackingStore | CWBackPixel,
                       &xswa );
   XMapWindow( graphic_display, graphic_window );
   
   /** sync and wait for exposure event **/
   XSync( graphic_display, False );
   XWindowEvent( graphic_display, graphic_window, ExposureMask, &exposureEvent );

   conn.display     = graphic_display;
   conn.drawable_id = graphic_window;

   xinfo.display = graphic_display;
   xinfo.flags.no_monitor = 0;      /* False -> Monitor is running! */
   xinfo.flags.force_client_SS = 0; /* False! */

   popen_xphigs( NULL, 0, PXPHIGS_INFO_FLAGS_NO_MON |
                          PXPHIGS_INFO_FLAGS_CLIENT_SS |
                          PXPHIGS_INFO_DISPLAY, &xinfo );

   popen_ws( 1, (Pconnid)(&conn), phigs_ws_type_x_drawable );

I get core dumps in the popen_ws call! (No BadAlloc, etc.! Simply a core
dump!) So I need some way of getting info about the maximal available memory
to the Xserver!

But thanks!

Sincerly,
        Matthias

Hello everybody,

I hope that I insert the right Options, so that my question is only
distributed through out Germany, because my question is more or less
country dependend.

Now the question:
  Is there anybody who can tell my if (and of course where) there is
  a ftp-site/archie (or whatever) where DIN fonts for X are available.
  I am looking for fonts holding the specification:
    DIN 16
    DIN 6776
    DIN V 40950

I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2.
I am having the following 2 problems.

(1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like
                /**/#This is a makefile
        at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C
        preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that
        I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the
        line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the
        start of a directive. 

        However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol
        as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines
        that "This" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my
        imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better
        fix.

(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular
        use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp
        gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.

If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate
information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later
version of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpp's
that behave similarly?

Since I do not have easy access to News, a response to
'white_billy@po.gis.prc.com' would be appreciated.

   Try change the GXxor to GXequiv.  I have to do this for programs that
   are to run on NCD terminals (on Sun terminals I have to change it
   back to GXxor)...

The multi-lingual archives at The Computing Research Labs, New Mexico
State University will be moving to a new ftp address soon.  The
archives are being put under control of the Consortium for Lexical
Research.

The new ftp address will be: clr.nmsu.edu (the current IP address
is 128.123.1.12 but may change, so use clr.nmsu.edu whenever
possible).

Please note that there is a difference between ftp sites crl.nmsu.edu and
clr.nmsu.edu.  The crl.nmsu.edu site will be our ftp site for items
not related to the Consortium for Lexical Research.

The Arabic, Chinese, French, Italian, Indian, Japanese, Korean,
Tibetan, and Vietnamese archives will all be moved.

We will announce the new locations of the relevant directories once
the archives have been moved.

Please be patient if you discover directories missing when you ftp to
either crl.nmsu.edu or clr.nmsu.edu.  It will take a few days to move
everything.

If you are not familiar with our multi-lingual archives, we have been
slowly collecting various software, fonts, and text for different
languages over the past 2 years.  Most of the software is currently
Unix oriented.  We would also like to encourage people to continue to
contribute items to the archives to help improve the quality and
quantity of multi-lingual tools.

If you have an item to contribute, please put it in:

clr.nmsu.edu:incoming/

and send a note to lexical@nmsu.edu telling them about your
contribution.

If you have any questions or comments, please send them to:
lexical@nmsu.edu

try this after XCreateWindow:
-----------------------------

#include <X11/Xutil.h>

Display display;
Window window;

{
  XSizeHints *xsizehints = XAllocSizeHints ();
  xsizehints->flags = USPosition | USSize;	/* or = PPosition | PSize */
  xsizehints->x = 42;
  xsizehints->y = 42;
  xsizehints->width = 100;
  xsizehints->height = 100;
  XSetWMNormalHints (display, window, xsizehints);
  XFree (xsizehints);
}

These hints tell the window manager that the position and size of the window
are specified by the users and that the window manager should accept these
values. If you use xsizehints->flags = PPosition | PSize, this tells the window
manager that the values are prefered values of the program, not the user.
I don't know a window manager that doesn't place the window like you prefer if
you specify the position and size like above.

test procedures and then run/rerun each time we do regression
testing. I am interested in a product like this for our UNIX
projects and for a separate project which will be using OpenVMS.

If it's any consolation, I have two 2-headed Sun-3/60 systems, though the
color and mono monitors for each are "rated" 1152x900.   Their configuration
is the same as yours, so it "should" be a Plug'N'Play situation, EXCEPT:

I don't know if your hi-res mono monitor will function this way.  However,
you may simply be able to pull the motherboard and set the HI-RES jumper
(located in the same jumper array as the jumpers for the RAM/SIMM selects
and Ethernet connection) and be happily on your way.  When you pull the
motherboard, the jumpers are in the left-rear (e.g. "north-west") quadrant
of the motherboard (to the left of the SIMM sockets).

It works on xterms. At least I have no problem with it. - Back to the original
question:

I usually start new xterms by selecting the proper menu entry in my desktop
menu. Here is a sample command:

	xterm -sl 999 -n ls12i -title ls12i -e rlogin ls12i &

The -n and -title options give the text for window and icon. As I use the
tcsh (a wonderful extension of the csh), I can do the following:

I have an

	alias precmd echo -n '^[]2\;${HOST}:$cwd^G'

in my ~/.tcshrc. This is a special alias for tvtwm. It is executed each time
before printing the prompt. So, I have the current host name and the current
directory path in the title bar of my xterms.

Do anyone know about any shading program based on Xlib in the public domain?
I need an example about how to allocate correct colormaps for the program.

Appreciate the help.

Have you gotten an answer yet?  Using your variables, this is what I would do:
	xterm -T "$HOST - $LOGNAME" -n "$HOST"

	I want to press a function key and have a text string appear in an
XmText widget.  When I put

	*XmText.Translations: #augment \n\
		<Key>F1:  insert-string(HELLO)

in my resource file, the translation doesn't happen.  If I put

	*XmText.Translations: <Key>F1:  insert-string(HELLO)

in the file, I get the text string HELLO when F1 is pressed, but no other 
keys work, which makes sense since the default translation mode is "replace".  

	Do I have a syntax problem here, or something deeper?

Animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident XImages into 
server resident Pixmap(s) using XPutImage.  Once this is done, the original XImages
can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using XCopyArea from the Pixmaps to the windows drawable.

Hope this is helpfull.

A few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which set
up an X app multiple times.  It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should
never be called more than once.  This helped.  However, I am still having
some problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models
my real program.  In the actual program, I am writing a library, callable
from any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function is
called, it must initialize things, and after that, it should just use the
old stuff (still around because of static variables).  In the demo below,
main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents
the interface to the library function.

#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <Xm/Xm.h>
#include <Xm/PushB.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void bla(XtAppContext app, Widget top)
{
        Widget topone = top;		// in real prog, these are member vars
        XtAppContext theapp = app;	// of a class
        int junk = 0;
        Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, &junk,
                                        NULL);

        Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget("blaaa", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,
                        topone,
                        XmNheight, 50,
                        XmNwidth, 50,
                        NULL);

        XtRealizeWidget(topone);
        for (int i=0;i<=25;i++)	// real prog returns when "Exit" button clicked
        {
                XEvent event;
                XtAppNextEvent(theapp, &event);
                XtDispatchEvent(&event);
        }
        XtDestroyWidget(box);
        XtCloseDisplay(dis);
}

// SetItUp - should be called once only
void SetItUp(XtAppContext *app, Widget *top)
{
        int junk = 0;
        (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app, "test", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,
                NULL, NULL, 0);
}

// doit - some library function callable from the outside
void doit()
{
        static XtAppContext app;	// use these every time called
        static Widget top;

        static int setup = 0;

        if (!setup)
        {
                SetItUp(&app, &top);
                setup = 1;
        }
        bla(app, top);
}

// main - program which links to my library
main()
{
        for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)
        {
                doit();
                printf("sleeping...\n");//widget still on screen at this point
                sleep(5);
        }
}


The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created.
(It is still on the screen -- unusuable -- during the "sleep" in the main prog,
despite the XtDestroyWidget call).

Anyone see something I'm missing?

Thanks very much.

I posted this a while ago and didn't recieve one reply, and now we
have another bug report on the same subject. Can anybody help me out?

How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of
case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one
menu entry.

In ORA Vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says "For information
on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4...", this is so you
know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.  If you go to
Vol. 4 it says, "Likewise, if a modifier is specified, there is
nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. For
example, the translation:

	Shift<Key>q:	quit()

will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as
the Shift key (and the q key).

This implies to me that setting XmNaccelerator to Ctrl<Key>o should do
what I want, but it doesn't, it doesn't work if the user presses the
control key, the shift key, and the o key.

Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry? Keep in
mind when answering this question that when using Motif you can't use
XtInstallAccelerators().

I am using Motif 1.1.3 on a DECstation 5000 but I have also tried it
on an HP using Motif 1.1.3 and 1.2.

I'm an new to this.  Having found some files (public) to look into, I
ftp'ed them to a system I have access to.  I then used kermit to transmit
them via modem to my host computer, a PC-based file system.  I access
internet through modem access to a university mainframe.  From the PC
file server, I pull the files to a disk, and then pull them from disk
to a SGI Indigo (the SGI is not networked yet).  When I try to uncompress
and un-tar the files, they either come out as garbage or I get an error
in the tar process about directories being invalid.
What I'm wondering about is the transfer of UNIX files (compressed,
binary,ascii) about multiple platforms.  My guess is that it is the copy
to a 'dos' disk that is screwing things up.  Any help is appreciated.

Hi everyone,

Does anyone know a good way to adjust colourmaps on the
fly (say during an animation) and prevent the current
set of colours from flickering?

Thanks,

Try this:

char *name=NULL;
unsigned long value;

if(XGetFontProperty(font, XA_FONT, value)) 
    name=XGetAtomName(dpy, value);

where dpy is your Display connection and font your XFontStruct pointer.

Can anyone explain the polygon fill rules for X? I know about the even-odd
rule but what is the nonzero winding number rule? What happens when the 
left and right boundary lines have many pixels on a given scanline? What 
are the rules concerning abutting polygons?(Are they the same as the 
join-style in the GC?) 

I've read the X pixelization rule but how does the X server determine the 
center point of a pixel? Is there any support for shading?(color interpolation)

Can someone point me to a definitive book that discusses these issues?

			Thanks in advance to the Gurus for there responses

I believe it's XtVaAppInitialize or something like that.

In SGI's distribution with their Indigo line (others as well, possibly),
they include source code for a GL widget that fits on top of Motif, and
one that's Xt based as well.  You may wish to ask IBM whether they
support this.

I have tried to contact one of the developers, Eric Swildens, at

Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks,

I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure
events are handled.

I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the
capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be
resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events.
The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event
calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a "fake" Expose
event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct)
to draw the data.

Quest 1.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.)
I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size
is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right?
Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?

Quest 2.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events
whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

Thanks in advance

Steve

Hi.  I've looked in the FAQ and the O-Reilly books and was unable to
find (an easy) means of finding out the state of state keys such as
CapsLock and NumLock.  I can certainly track the events inside of my
window and set a boolean there, but what if CapsLock is pressed in
another window?  I looked at XGrabKey() and decided it was definitely
NOT what I wanted to do.  I could find no convenience function to tell
me that information.

My question is this:  Is there a means of determining what the state
of CapsLock and/or NumLock is?

An even more pointed question: Is there an easy means of making an X
keyboard act like a PC keyboard?  ie, CapsLock is active, and the user
presses shift-a, I'd like to get a lowercase 'a' instead of 'A'.

Any input is greatly appreciated. Please respond via email.  I will
repost a summary of my findings.

			Thanks, Ralph

store and reply of mouse and keyboard events
--------------------------------------------

To produce regression tests or automatic demo's
we would like to store all mouse and keyboard events
produced by a user. It should be possible to filter
the mouse and keyboard events from the server's queue
an to store them in a file.
This sequence of events, stored in a file, should be given 
to the server's queue as if a user is working.


1. Exists a tool that is capable to save and reply all
   mouse and keyboard events (where)?

2. Where one can catch these events to store them ?
   In our case the server's queue is on a X Terminal (HP).
   Where can we catch all events coming from a given
   server.
   If this is not possible, can we catch all events given
   to a certain client and how ?
   
3. Where one can send a stored sequence of events to simulate a user ?
   Is there a central dispatcher on the clients machine who manages
   all incoming events from a given server and how can we reach it ?


Thanks in advance

Ron.

Hi, I'm new to this group so please bear with me!

Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've
finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView.
I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage()
is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the
Sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory
pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that:
(1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or
(2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is, what
is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to
a window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
running on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck with
XPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)?

All help appreciated...thanks!

      Try change the GXxor to GXequiv.  I have to do this for programs that
      are to run on NCD terminals (on Sun terminals I have to change it
      back to GXxor)...

There is a small section in the O'Reilly Xlib books that describes
the right thing to do.  The key is to set the plane_mask in the
GC to the OR of the foreground and background pixel values.

I "think" you should try linking to /usr/lib/libXmu.a instead of 
-lXmu. At least that solved the problem for me!

authorization in Open Windows 3.0 for a long while and
would like some help please!  I generally use strait
MIT X, and so don't use OW much, but when I share 
X software with others - bad news.

PROBLEM:

My friend who logs into his SSII trys to run my 
program that runs fine on my machine, however, 
my friend gets "client not authorized to connect 
to server" (or something close).  If OW is started
with the -noauth option all is well, but surely this
is not required in general!

Also, xhost + does not work, becoming root does not 
work, etc... 

Any help will be greatly appreciated!

Thanx

#I have a question regarding the processing of program arguments
#such as the -geometry option. Since this is a standard X option, 
#I'm wondering wether I have to parse it manually or whether there
#is some predefined function that will do this for me?
#

If you are using the Intrinsics, it is parsed for you.  If you are working
at the Xlib level, you can parse it yourself or you can use the following
bit of code.

static XrmOptionDescRec options[] = {
	{"-geometry",	".geometry",	XrmoptionSepArg, (XPointer)NULL}
};

#define Number(x)	(sizeof(x)/sizeof(x[0]))
XrmParseCommand(db, options, Number(options), "MyApplication", &argc, argv);

Then use XrmGetResource() to retrieve the value and parse it using
XParseGeometry().

It is probably quicker to parse it yourself from argv, however, I much prefer
using the X resource management routines to do this.

Thanx, Jeff. You're a lifesaver. I imported the new sun GX emulator that came in

Using XPutImage, your source is maintained by the client and the
destination is maintained by the server, thus you incur the overhead
of transporting through whatever client-server communications
mechanism you are using.

Is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps?
These are maintained by the server, so copying them into a window is
much cheaper.

Also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary XSyncs, or running
in XSynchonize mode.

I've installed X11R5 with patches for Solaris 2.1 on our SPARCstation LX /
SPARCclassic pool. On the LX, X11R5 runs fine, but on the classics,
after giving the command startx, Xsun prints the following messages:
	WARNING: cg3_mmap: can't map dummy space!
	Mapping cg3c: No such device or address
and exits.

Does anybody know how to fix this problem?

Thanks in advance.

A question like this is answered in the FAQ, about sharing X windows.
One of the answers is XTrap, a record and playback extenstion to X.  You
can find it at export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/XTrapV33_X11R5.tar.Z.

Does anyone know of a program which doesn't require an X extension?  Most
the the X servers we have at work have vendor extensions which we can't
modify, so XTrap doesn't help up.  There is X conferencing software at
mit, but I don't know how easy it would be to modify it to do record and
playback.

Any help would be appreciated.

I don't know if this might help, but I've just started playing with a program
called POVRay (Persistance of Vision Raytracer) that also displays its output
via X Windows.  It does a fairly good job of allocating the colormap on my
Psuedo-Color 8-plane display.  I got the source from from a site in Canda.
The person I retrieved them from was David Buck (dbuck@ccs.carleton.ca).

What "it may think is right" may be exactly what the user wants.
Assuming that your application "has reason to know better" is, IMHO,
anti-social.  If I start your application with a -geometry option are
you going to ignore that as well?

There's really no way to force a window manager to do much of anything
if it's managing your window.  You can ask, you can hint, but there's
no guarantee that you're going to get what you want.

You are right but PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.  It makes my brain hurt.
USPosition and USSize should ONLY be set if the USER specified the
position and size.

You say: "Tom, don't blow a gasket, what's the harm?"

Some window managers do very different things (besides positioning the window)
when they see USPosition rather than PPosition.

I  am  having  a  big problem trying to build MIT X11R5 with xlc 1.2.1
(the  one  bundled  with  AIX  3.2.3e).   Its almost the linker is not
working properly with shared libraries.

I've built X11R5 with no problem before .. but now its all  headaches.
For example, the xset client complains that libXmu doesnt have a bunch

build of libXmu DOES link in libXt  so I am really perplexed  what  is
going on.

This is a bug in Sun's shared libraries. Linking with
'-assert nodefinitions' should do the trick.

Hi there netters,

I require a window to appear at a co-ordinates (0,0) (top left corner) of my
screen (root window). Could some windows guru out there help me on how to
go about doing this. I write the whole program which creates the window with
the image it displays - I require the image to appear at the top-left corner
so that I can grab it for recording on to video, using a MIniVas controller,
which expects the window at the same spot every time.

Thanks in advance.

sincerely,

Sanjeev Sharma

I just had an idea. I'm not sure if its been done and I'm just
remembering it unconsiously, but I thought that in dialog
boxes and whatever in windowing systems, there should be a
way to intuitivly set some things checked or unchecked or
filled in a certain way. My idea: tape. You know, like putting
a piece of tape over a light switch?
Just an idea, if you like it, use it.

[again, poseted for a friend]

Okay, I got such great response from my last question (thanks, everyone), 
lets try again:

How can I tell if a colorcell is read-only?

I want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap
once I start running out of allocatable cells, using some arbitrary
nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to
a requested color.

Once I determine if a cell is read-only, I assume I can then just request
an XAllocColor() with the exact same color specifications and it will 
then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get
freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another
application.

So far, the only way I've figured out to do this is to write my own
error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors, once my
colormap is all full up.  It should error out if the cell is non-shareable.
But life would be much easier if I could just detect the
read-only/shareable stuff directly...

Any ideas?

Would if only it were true ...

If only MIT would fix the !@&$^*@ twm "InstallWindowColormaps()" crash bug
once and for all, then I could say that I've (almost) unable to crash either
"twm" or "tvtwm", which would be a remarkable feat - and most desirable to

Now *servers*, on the other hand ... (want to crash an OpenWindows 3.0 "xnews"
server at will?  Just do an 'xbiff -xrm "XBiff*shapeWindow: on"'.  Blammo.)

Hello...

I wonder if some one can suggest an answer to the following question:
I am a total X novice and would appreciate any suggestions you may have.

I am trying to create a simple drawing tool....

       __________
       |        |
       |     ___|___
       |_____|__|  |
             |	   |
	     |_____|

Let's say I have two rectangles on the canvas(see above) 
one intersecting the other...
Now, I would like to delete one of the rectangles.
The way I do it is to create another GC wherein I use the
GXxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the newly
created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes.
A problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel 
locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white, which is 
something that should be avoided.

Is there any way I can avoid this problem without having to redraw the other
rectangle too?
I also would not like to generate an expose event for the affected area
as this degrades performance very badly...


Thank you...
Gopal

Any suggestions?

NCSA Mosaic provides a consistent and easy-to-use hypermedia-based
interface into a wide variety of networked information sources,
including Gopher, WAIS, World Wide Web, NNTP/Usenet news, Techinfo,
FTP, local filesystems, Archie, finger, Hyper-G, HyTelnet, TeXinfo,
telnet, tn3270, and more.

This release of NCSA Mosaic is known to compile on the following
platforms:

  SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) 
  IBM (AIX 3.2)
  Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.3 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1, and GCC).
  DEC Ultrix.
  DEC Alpha AXP (OSF/1).

Documentation is available online.

Changes since 0.13 include:

 o Added new resource, gethostbynameIsEvil, for Sun's that
   coredump when gethostbyname() is called to try to find out what
   their own names are. (Command-line flag is -ghbnie.) 
 o Explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view
   window is closed, for window managers too dull to do so
   themselves. 
 o Better visited anchor color for non-SGI's. 
 o Added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files. 
 o Added 'Clear' button to Open box, to allow more convenient
   cut-n-paste entries of URL's. 
 o New resource 'autoPlaceWindows'; if set to False, new document
   view windows will not be automatically positioned by the
   program itself (but it's still up to your window manager just how
   they're placed). 
 o Command-line flags -i and -iconic now have desired effect (new
   resource initialWindowIconic can also be used). 
 o Gif-reading code is a little more bulletproof. 
 o Obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in IMG tag fixed. 
 o Eliminated nonintuitive error message when image can't be read
   (inlined NCSA bitmap is indication enough that something's not
   right for authors, and readers can't do anything about bad images
   in any case). 
 o Obscure parsing bug (for constructs like <ADDRESS><A
   HREF=...>text<A></ADDRESS>) fixed. 
 o Fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits Suns. 
 o Fixed stupid coredump on URL's like '://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/'. 
 o Fixed buglet in handling rlogin URL's. 
 o New support for Solaris/SYSVR4 (courtesy
   dana@thumper.bellcore.com). 
 o Better support for HP-UX 8.x and 9.x (courtesy
   johns@hpwarf.wal.hp.com). 
 o Better support for NeXT (courtesy scott@shrug.dur.ac.uk). 
 o Some miscellaneous portability fixes (courtesy
   bingle@cs.purdue.edu). 
 o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups. 

Comments, questions, and bug reports should be sent to
mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu.  Thanks in advance for any feedback you can
provide.

Cheers,
Marc

	There is a free program called 'xkernel' which does just that.
It is by Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu).  It takes a sun 3 and
boots a limited kernel which allows you to run X.  We converted 4
machines over this semester and the speedup is enormously appreciable
-- I find them faster than an NCD 15inch black&white XTerminal that we
are playing with, and a bigger screen to boot!  As a matter of fact,
the department just bought some old sun3s at an auction to convert!

} Xkernel is available for anonymous ftp from ftp.ctr.columbia.edu
} [128.59.64.40] in /Xkernel/Xkernel.shar (/Xkernel is a symlink to the
} latest version of Xkernel)

	Note that the compiled version which is available is for the
sun 3/50, but compiling to work for a sun 3/1xx should be quite easy.

	I am not connected with xkernel except as a satisfied
installer and user 8).  I may be able to answer questions; feel free
to email me.

Hi, I'm new to this group so please bear with me!

Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've
finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView.
I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage()
is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the
Sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory
pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that:
(1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or
(2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is, what
is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to
a window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
running on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck with
XPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)?

All help appreciated...thanks!

I just implemented this and it seems I can just about achieve the display
rates (20 400x400x8 frames / sec on IPX) that I get with Sunview, though
it's a bit "choppy" at times. Also, loading the data, making an XImage,
then XPut'ing it into a pixmap is a bit cumbersome, so the animation is
slower to load than with Sunview. Is there a better way to load in the
data?

Shared memory PutImage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu,
Nick Kisseberth) looks interesting, but I need someone to point me to some
documentation. Is this method likely to give better results than server-
resident pixmaps? I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code
mentioned above...

Thanks for the help so far. If I get something decent put together, I'll
definitely post it to the Net.

I'm running X under openwindows 3.  Normal X programs not having a
font specified always show up in the same font - until I change the
fontpath, and restart windows - then a new default font is used until
the next change.  I can't seem to figure out how it chooses.  Is there
some way to set this?  Possibly something in .Xdefaults???

Please reply in direct email - I summarize.

Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position
and the window at a position below it.

This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
configuration and restore is later.

Currently, my solution is:

	XCreateWindow(...);
	XSetWMProperties(..);
	XMapWindow(...);
	XFlush(...);
	XMoveWindow(...);


It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering
if I'm overlooking something obvious.

Usually when I start up an application, I first get the window outline
on my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actually
place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry 
option the window appears right away, the properties specified by
the -geometry argument. The question now is:

How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify
window position with a mouseclick? I've tried explicitly setting window
size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour.

Thanks for any hints

PS: I'm working in plain X.

The protocol has to move the whole image from process memory to server
memory, this is the hog. The conversions in the XPutImage() are
fast.

Yes, by utilizing the MIT-SHM extension, that provides an XPutImage
derivate that uses shared memory. Fine fast.

No. You can still XPutImage all of the frames onto pixmaps (thus moving
them to server memory) and then replay them fastest using XCopyArea()
BUT be aware, this is a major server memory bummer !

   A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation.
When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear
with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows
applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a
second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window,
giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.

   The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial
one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier
colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only
opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL
X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the
command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different
font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the
default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose
all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the
fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font
directories/hash-tables.

   Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different
font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?

More info:  This is the most recent MIPS workstation (R4000 I believe),
       with the most current operating system and running X11R5.
       It is not mwm's fault, as the same problems occur under twm, etc.

Hello,

I am testing a port of X11R5 to Coherent, a unix clone OS for Intel architecture
machines.  I am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simple
terminal emulator program).

The problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the
server for display, one at a time.  The characters appear to be too closely
spaced, with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the 
rightmost edge of the first character, then the 3rd character destroys the 
rightmost edge of the second character, and so on.  It looks like there is an
invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous
character.  There is no problem between the characters when the shell returns
a complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individual
characters.

If anyone has any ideas what the problem might be, or where I should look to
find it, it would be much appreciated.

Regards and thanks, Jon Dhuse.

The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators,
and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately,
the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined
with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case:
"Ctrl Any<Key>q".

This is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using
event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If
you're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics
changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the
documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's
expectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as
translations.

If you mean "menu accelerator", no it's not possible.  That's according to
the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.

I can't think of a reason why not.

There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu
accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators
resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's
accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with
XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).

For example,

  applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade
					  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton
							  - exitPushbutton

  *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O
  *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O
  *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q
  *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q

  *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\n\
    Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\n\
    Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)

You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you
can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then
XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.

I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I
used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators
on the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead
of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I
described above should work.

  The MIT tapes come with documentation written by Keith Packard on the Shared
  Memory Extension to X. Look in:  mit/doc/extensions/mit-shm.ms
  I found this invaluble. Unfortunately, there is a bit of work to set up the
  shared memory segments, making an XImage from it, etc. Also, there is an
  extension query to determine if the server supports it, but you still need to
  test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled
  in the kernel. I have written layers of convience routines which make all this
  transparent.
  As for the XView code, well, I doubt that would be considered interesting.
  The interesting stuff is done in a C object library. People interested in this
  code can Email me.

I need help binding some value to the HOME and END keys on my keyboard.  I have an
rs/6000 w/ aix3.2.3ext running X11R5pl19 mit dist.  I'm using a PC running eXceed
for windows as my xterminal.  The HOME and END keys do not send a value, and my
application needs them to be defined.  I used this in my Xdefaults to define the
keys:

varnet*VT100.Translations: #override \
    <Key>Home: string("\033[8~") \n\
    <Key>End: string("\033[7~")

Then I xterm -name varnet.  This works perfect, however the 7 and the 1 key on my
keypad are also defined as \033[8~ and \033[7~.

Any ideas?  Help please.

Thanks.

Thanks for docs info. It turns out that if I leave out colormap updates between
frames and use tvtwm, my tests with 100 400x400x8 frames on an IPX using the
server-resident pixmap method give an astonishing *50* frames per second! And
VERY smooth. I think I've found the best solution (thanks to the generous help
on this group!) However, I may have colormap questions later.....

  There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the
X11R5 distribution.

  Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program...
(take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using
on-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep
it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they
were just about equal.

  The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous
sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your
application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when
debugging SHM apps).

  Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g.
Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be
attached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes
XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24
bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to
support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using
pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to
use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one
copies the info three times per redraw instead of one).

  In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a
Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick
whatever feels fastest.

  (I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :)

	I want to be able to send a Pixmap from one client to the next.
Along with this I want to send the Colormap and foreground and
background pixel values.  So far not a problem, I can do
this with no problem.

  However, once I have the Pixmap id and the Colormap id, how
do I go about telling the server that the second (receiving)
client now wants to have associations with the two id's?

I consider TWM-style Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window
manager. I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same
time, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have
other xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.

In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here's a crude
picture:

 ====================== Figure 1 ====================================
 |
 |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+
 |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +
 |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+
 |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +
 |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  +
 |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +
 |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+
 |
 ====================== Figure 1 ====================================

Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack,
with easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really
need, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.

The only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it
is configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit
that file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and
time-consuming.

Therefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right }
functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click
of a button, you can change this:

    +---------+
    + title A +
    +------------------------+
    +   this is the          +
    +     body of the        +
    +      window, window A  +
    +------------------------+

to this:

                   +---------+
                   + title A +
    +------------------------+
    +   this is the          +
    +     body of the        +
    +      window, window A  +
    +------------------------+

 ===============

Okay. So far, so good. Now, how the heck do I get them to put this
into the next "official" twm, and the next tvtwm, and the next vtwm,
and the next ctwm? And the next xyztwm that I never heard of?

One way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this
enhancement, together with an explanation of why I think it is a
Very Good Thing, and hope that someone reads it. :-)

In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing,
look back up at Figure 1, and picture window A moved over on top of
windows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title;
but when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is:

        +=========+   +---------+   +=========+
        + title B +   + title A +   + title C +
        +-------------------------------------+
        +   this is the body of the window,   +
        +   window A, which is on top.        +
        +-------------------------------------+

 ===================

The rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my
X11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the
full diffs would be too long.

The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the
ExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c:

#ifdef SHAPE
	case F_SQUEEZELEFT:
	{	static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 };
		if (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor))
		  return TRUE;

		tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze;
		SetFrameShape( tmp_win );
		break;
	}
	.... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and
	squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ...
#endif

( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h
  and add
    { "f.squeezeleft", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },
     ... and so forth ...
to parse.c

In order to use these functions, add something like the
following to your .twmrc file:

Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter

 =================

About a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I
*think* it didn't get out.

Since then, "blast" has appeared in comp.sources.x, Volume 19,
Issue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect, by
chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title. Better to have a
twm-style window manager, I think.

There is no easy answer to this question: it depends on whether the display
device can hold pixmaps in off-screen memory, and if so, how efficiently
the server manages these resources (having to deal with limited off-screen
memory is the bane of the server implementor's existence!).  

I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to 
main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy
rate, and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than
off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather
than a read of the F.B. followed by a write)

If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into
pixmaps in CPU main memory, the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are
likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower, depending on your OS's implementation
of shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window, which is also then
just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device.

One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large, you don't end up
growing the size of the server process to hold them.

One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that, in its sample implementation,
there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments
if the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., "kill").  You have to 
be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.

 Hi Xperts!
   I have a Sparc-1 with very limited disk space on /usr partition.
   previously, i was able to run all x-windows applications  and then 
   i upgraded my system to sun o.s. 4.1.3 and realized that , the hard
disk did not have enough space to load openwindows. My immediate alternative
was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system. This resulted in
not loading openwindows. As a result of which none of the X-libraries got loaded.

   I am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin/X11 files 
required for running X-windows and compiling my programs written for Xlib and Xaw.
In a desperate effort to regain x-windows, i retrieved /usr/lib/libX*.* files from
the tape . /usr/bin/X11/*  and /usr/include/X11/* . Is this enough for running X-windows
 
 BUt i did not get /usr/lib/X11/fonts/  sub directories . these are mainly 100dpi, 75dpi
 and misc. 

when i run xinit, the error message says /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi etc are not in the
default path. But the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no
disk space. 
Are there any temporary suggestions before I get a 1.5 GB disk and load openwindows , to
just have my x-windows running. 

Thanks

Pramod

Can anyone give me some information, please ...

I need (probably) to write one or more new Motif widgets on the HP-UX
platform. Do I need the Motif private header files and source,
or can I make do with the public headers that are provided?
"Motif" includes Xt in this context.

One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have
already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be
a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.
Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?

Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they
could sell me, this might save me from having to write one!
Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not
yet have the spec)?

Answers appreciated,

Nicholas.

The reason they place their outside corner at the location you requested

This code will almost certainly break.  Calling XMapWindow and then
XFlush does not guarantee that the window is visible and managed by the
window manager.  Even if this did work, there isn't a reliable way to
find out how much decoration the window manager placed around your
window, so you don't know how far to move it.  And what if the window
manager refuses to move your window?

	Because xterminals do not have a NeWS server.  xterminals have
speed by nature of their limited functionality: once you add NeWS and
everything else, you have a workstation.  There are workarounds, I've
heard, one involving a perl script.  What we are trying to do is
replace programs that need NeWS (like pageview) with programs that
don't (like ghostview).
	Maybe someone else can elaborate on the perl workaround; I
have no personal experience with it.

I have an applicationShell which uses a colormap created with
XCreateColormap() and uses all of the colors available for my 8-bit
display.  When I move the cursor over the window I get the "Technicolor
Effect" - which is fine.  Basically, my program works.

My problem/question is: When I popup a dialogShell to prompt the user for
some input I want the XmNdialogStyle to be set to
XmDIALOG_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_MODAL.  The result is that if my cursor is
over the dialogShell I get my colormap, but if the cursor is over the
applicationShell (or any window other than the dialogShell) I get the
default colormap.  But I'd like it so that if my cursor is over _any_
window of my application, I get my colormap.

Any suggestions?  Thanks,

david,

Hi,
I have a problem when compiled Wcl 2.02 in SCO ODT 2.0:


        cc -c -Ox  -I.. -I/usr/include Xt4GetResL.c
Xt4GetResL.c
Xt4GetResL.c(47) : error C2065: '_XtConstraintBit' : undefined
*** Error code 1

Although I follow the instructions in file README_BUILD to build Wcl in SCO 
platform, this problem didn't resolve.

So I have some questions related to this matter:

  1. Does _XtConstraintBit exist in SCO ODT 2.0? ( Does _XtConstraintBit use
      in X11R3 & X11R4? And What release does SCO ODT 2.0 use, X11R3 or X11R4?)
  2. If not, Does someone know how to work around?

  When I run our RS6000's "info" utility through a remote login

  lower case in any of info's window prompt's.

  I thought the prob. may have been due to my Sun window mgr. 
  (Openlook) being incompatible with the AIX Motif application
  but I tried it under TVTWM also.  Same result.
  
  So this is presumably an X11 key definition problem between 
  workstations - but my system admins. feign ignorance.
  
  What do I need to do the be able to type lower case into 
  this remote AIX motif app. from within my local Openlook
  window manager?

I find this thread on motif accelerators absoultly amazing.  If I were
writing an interface to keyboard accelerators, I would have one
resource called "accelerators" that took a translation table, period.
I would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work
to get the accelerators installed.  As soon as the end-user specified
one, it would be active and automatically installed.

To get multiple accelerators on a single menu item I'd do something like:

	*menuItem.accelerators: #override \n\
		Ctrl<Key>M:	fire() \n\
		Shift<Key>L:	fire() \n

The accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would
automatically see a "Ctrl M" show up in your menuItem object.

Why in the world is the motif stuff so complicated with so many different
special cases depending on what type of widget you're dealing with?  There
has to be some reason.

Sorry for the political tone of this message...

  Correct. Most X servers use a version of  malloc(3)  which will not return
  memory to the OS (ie. the X server might  free(3)  a Pixmap, but the heap does
  not shrink).

  Well, part of the routines I mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around
  that problem. First, I create the shared memory segment, attach the client,
  attach the X server, and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man
  pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment
  only dies after all attachments are gone.
  Now, if the client dies, that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)
  and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up it's resources,
  including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. No more
  shared memory segment.
  Terrible, but it works.

I am writing a custom widget to support the display of graphics
and imagery.  The user of the widget will be able to specify,
when creating it, whether it is to operate in X or GL mode.

I have set up translations and actions to handle mouse button
presses.  They work fine when the widget is in X mode.  In GL 
mode they only work when the widget (my GL/X widget) is a child
of a manager.  Put another way, the translations do not work 
when the widget is configured in GL mode and is a child of a 
shell.  Does anyone know why this is happening?

Thanks in advance.

I am using the GLX widget + athena widgets on a mixed-model
application, under 4Dwm, but when the dialog gets popped up, its
text entry field does not have focus. Aimilar code works perfectly if
I use "pure X" (no mixed-model). HEre is the relevant portion of
the code.

{
   int n;
   Arg wargs[16];
   Widget Button, PopUpShell, Dialog;

   /* initialize TopLevel here */
   .
   .
   .

   n = 0;
   XtSetArg(wargs[n], XtNlabel, "Foo"); n++;
   Button = XtCreateManagedWidget("FooBtn", commandWidgetClass,
                                  TopLevel, wargs, n);

   PopUpShell = XtCreatePopupShell("PupShell", overrideShellWidgetClass,
                                   Button, NULL, 0);
   XtAddCallback(PopUpShell, XtNcallback, MyPopUp, (XtPointer)PopUpShell);

   n = 0;
   XtSetArg(wargs[n], XtNvalue, ""); n++;
   Dialog = XtCreateManagedWidget("TheDialog", dialogWidgetClass,
                                  PopUpShell, wargs, n);

   .
   .
   .
}

void MyPopUp(w, popup_shell, call_data)
Widget w;
Widget popup_shell;
XtPointer call_data;
{
   XtPopup(popup_shell, XtGrabExclusive);
}

---

A way I found to give focus to the text field is to move the
application window around a little bit and place it right behind the popup.

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

On the code I sent, please replace the line:

   XtAddCallback(PopUpShell, XtNcallback, MyPopUp, (XtPointer)PopUpShell);

by

   XtAddCallback(Button, XtNcallback, MyPopUp, (XtPointer)PopUpShell);

I know for a fact that the EISA version of the Orchid ProDesigner IIS
works.  However, an EISA SVGA card is likely a waste of money.

When XFree86 2.0 comes out, with support for accelerated chipsets, ISA,
EISA, and VLB will all be supported.

The more important question is "what chipsets are supported?".  The bus
is basically irrelevent as a compatibility issue.

You could set up a bitmap with a mask in it.  Clear the
bitmap, draw the rectangle to be deleted with GXor.  Draw the one
that is to stay with GXclear.  Then GXxor the entire pixmap with
the screen.  

Note that this is a pretty effective way of animation, if you ever
need to do that (replace the GXclear with a GXxor).

I am having problems with a  Motif application that when run on another machine
(with different X paths, etc) can't find the XKeysymDB file.   This causes a large
warning output:

Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfActivate
Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfActivate:ManagerParentActivate()'
Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfCancel
Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfCancel:ManagerParentCancel()'
Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfSelect
Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfSelect:ManagerGadgetSelect()'
...
....
....
etc.

as the file is in a different location, but Xt seems to only look for it in
the place where it is on the machine the app was compiled on.  Is there any
way to read the XKeysymDB manually with an X/Xt call so that additions to
the XKeysymDB can be distributed with the application ?  I have used trace(1)
to find out what was going on, but I need a fix so that these translations in
the application can be recognised.

They come with every Iris now.  Nth also ships it with their latest
version of Nth Portable GL.  I just got the update a couple of weeks
ago.  I would assume that Silicon Graphics would license the source
to you so that you can include it in your company's GL offering.

Yes.  You'll find it almost impossible without the source
at this point.  It does depend on how ambitious you are and
how concerned you are about compliance with the general
interface and items like traversal.

   One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have
   already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be
   a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.
   Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?

I'm not sure what you're asking.  You could create something
which is very much like a true multi-column list by placing
several lists within a geometry manager,  and putting that
manager within an automatic scrolled window.  This wouldn't
be good for very large lists,  but you might consider this
as an alternative.

   Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they
   could sell me, this might save me from having to write one!
   Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not
   yet have the spec)?

Motif 1.2 does not have a multi-column list in it.  Have you
looked at commercial sets?  There are also some PD 
widget sets,  one of these might have a multi-column list
you could port.

Alright.  Ignore this.  I have delved a bit deeper (XKeyEvent) and
found what I was looking for.

ev->state   has a bunch of masks to check against (LockMask is the one
for CapsLock).  Unfortunately, it appears that the NumLock mask varies
from server to server.  How does one tell what mask is numlock and
which are for Meta (Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask).
eg, SGI's vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock, whereas Solaris
1.0.1 OpenWindows 3.0 has Mod3Mask for NumLock.  Is there an
unambiguous means of determining NumLock's mask at runtime for any
given server?  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance.

I have the March/April version of the X Journal open in front of me.

I'll be working on programming x-clients this summer, and since I don't have
much experience with programming X, I thought this issue might be helpful
as it has a section on debugging, and a section on the 40 most common errors
in programming X.

At the end of the errors section, there are the following references for
tutorials on X programming style.  They are:

Rosenthal, David -   A simple X11 client program
  Proceedings of the Winter 1988 Usenix Conference, 1988.

Lemke, D., and Rosenthal, D. -  Visualizing X11 clients
  Proceedings of the Winter 1989 Usenix Conference, 1989.


Does anyone know where I could find these in printed or (preferably)
electronic form?

Or can you suggest any net resources devoted to the introduction to
programming X (I'll be looking at the bookstore for books, so I am really
only asking about what I can find on the net.)

Thanks,

David Simpson

Thanks to those who responded.

We were able to prevent this behaviour by two methods:

1) running twm rather than olwm
2) keeping olwm, but putting "wmTimeout: 10" in the resources

It has been suggested that the difficuty was something to do with the
window manager positioning the popup window. Any guru who can analyse
what is going on from this information, please post and let us know.

Hi folks

Say, I'm new to R5 and have one quick question.

In using xon ( xon  <machine_name> )  , I notice that it
always comes up with a very small window .  I'm pretty
sure its the default font.  My xterms all work normally.
Is xon supposed to read your .Xresources for a font size ?

xrdb -q appears to show the right stuff.

I can use xon with arguments such as  xterm -fn 10x20    etc
and everything is correct.  Of course you could always do a 
simple script to do this , but I have a feeling I'm missing
something simple here.

Comments / suggestions appreciated.

Thanks in advance

Hear! Hear! I agree completely. One thing I can't stand about
the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use
the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is
down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such
as cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for most
work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than
using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something
simple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it
before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at
the moment.)
	I don't think it is too much to ask that window
programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also
look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and
command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in
less time IF you are experienced.
	All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on
UNIX (especially since Unix is at least 500% more powerful than
DOS).

  QUESTION:
  What is the EXACT entry (parameter and syntax please), in the X-Terminal
configuration file (loaded when the X-Terminal boots), to add another system 
to the TCP/IP access control list?   

  BACKGROUND:
  I have two unix systems, 1. an AT&T 3B2 running X11R3 and MIT's X11R4 and 
2. a Sun SS10 without any X.  
  I want to have a window to the Sun and the 3B2 on the NCD X-Terminal at the
same time.  I can do this if I manually set the Network Parameter TCP/IP
Access Control List to off, then login to my telnet session. Not Great!  
  I've tried to get "xhost" to work and failed.  Either my syntax is wrong
or the X11R3 implementation is bogus.  
  I am trying to edit the NCD configuration file that is loaded when the 
NCD boots.  No matter what entry I add or edit, the NCD still boots with
the TCP/IP Access Control list containing only the 3B2.
  My manuals are worthless so any help would be most appreciated!!  Thanks!

The error I get (yes, the 4TH time I try to show the box) is:

Please respond via email.  Thanks very, very much!

Hi netland,

I thought that I once read about the existance of a virtual mwm like vtwm.
On the usual ftp sites (gatakeeper.dec.com, export.lcs.mit.edu) I can't find
any trace of this program. Could anybody give me a hint where to find this
program or confirm/deny the existance of this program.

Regards,

  Stefan

I am in the process of installing X11R5 on my Sun Sparcstation 2 and
have run into a problem.  I imagine it has something to do with a missing
screen driver, or something along those lines, but figured someone out there
in Internet land might be able to help.

I am installing it on a machine that already has OpenLook installed, and would
like to have both installed concurrently.  Thus, I set it up to compile to my
/usr/X11R5 directory.  I worked out all the kinks in getting it compiled (with
gcc), so that it compiles without any warnings.  I need it installed for PEX-SI,
so I set all those appropriate flags.  When I run it, however, I get a message
along the lines of:

Getting interface configuration : Operation not supported on socket

sunOpenFrameBuffer : Inappropriate ioctl for device

Fatal server error : no screens found 


Any ideas on how I can fix it?  Please respond by e-mail at the below
address.

Thanks in advance.

I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2.
I am having the following 2 problems.

(1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like
		/**/#This is a makefile
	at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C
	preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that
	I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the
	line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the
	start of a directive. 

	However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol
	as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines
	that "This" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my
	imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better
	fix.

(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular
	use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp
	gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.

If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate
information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later
version of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpp's
that behave similarly?

Since I do not have easy access to News, a response to
'white_billy@po.gis.prc.com' would be appreciated.

   Currently, my solution is:

   It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering

   Richard.


I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for
the border of a window or for the "user" window. Maybe other window managers
have similar options.
Another way to figure out the difference between the "user" window position
and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their
positions. You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager
decorations window is the parent of your window. Unfortunately, you can only
figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped
this way.

Why is that terrible ? That's exactly the way our code has been doing

Dear netters,

I have noticed something rather weared (I think) about creating a dialog shell
widget while running HP Vue's vuewm.

For some reason, every time I create a dialog shell the foreground and backgroun
d colors are different compared to my toplevel shell.
I am not doing anything special/different.

Does any body know anything about this problem?? How to fix it without hardcodin
g the colors ?

Please respond to kamlesh@salzo.cary.nc.usa ....

You'll have to check the keysym(s) on each of the keys for each
modifier. The one with NumLock in its mapping is the modifier
you want. A bit ugly perhaps but I think its currently the only
way to do this (and it does have some precedent as keysyms are 
used to differentiate CapsLock from ShiftLock for the Lock
modifier).

I don't know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous
assignments either. (ie. what if NumLock is mapped for more then
one modifier). I suppose first found is as good as any.

X doesn't handle locking modifiers that well. 

Hope that helps,

Dave Lapp

can be either public domain or commercial, although a commercial package
can't have royalties required for binary only distribution.  we need 2-d
graphing capabilities at a minimum, but 3-d  would be nice.  any info would
be appreciated and i will summarize if there is interest.

It might be that the X terminal doesn't support the "Postscript
Extensions to X" product.  I use the 'dxpsview' program on a 
DECstation 5000 to view postscript files but when I moved to an
NCD X terminal, I couldn't use it any more.  So I ftp'd and
compiled GhostScript (GNU software).  Now we can view postscript
files on our X terminals.

Hope this helps.

Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into
emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to
change the source code so that all of these special keys generated
character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier
state as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence "ESC [ 1 B 7" 
would indicate that the "HOME" key was pressed, with the shift key
down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such
as "shift-Return".

If anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll
have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with
it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code
in the source file "x11term.c".  Maybe if someone at OSF is 
interested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got
bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about 
emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods 
somewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.

Notes: 

 * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create
   its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which 
   includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.

 * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2
   [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].  The patches are
   in a chunk of code between '#if sun ... #endif' but could 
   easily be adapted for anything else.

[Apologies if I'm answering something already answered in the FAQ.
Our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately - so I haven't
seen the FAQ lately to check.]


Two ways:
 
 1) When you start the xterm, you can use command line options:
         -n ICON_NAME           To set the icon label
         -T WINDOW_TITLE        To set the window title
         -title WINDOW_TITLE    Equivalent to -T WINDOW_TITLE

 2) You can use escape sequences to change things on the fly:

    The basic escape sequence is:
	ESC ] <P> ; <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> BEL

    where ESC and BEL are the ASCII ESCAPE and BELL characters,
    <P> is an ASCII decimal digit -- '2', '1', or '0', depending
    on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title,
    or both, and <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> is your desired label string.

    Hence, this command will set the window & icon title:
         echo "\033]0;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c" 

    To set just the icon title:
         echo "\033]1;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c" 

    To set just the window title:
         echo "\033]2;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c" 

    Of course, you may have to fiddle with exact syntax,
    depending on how the echo command works on your system
    and what shell you are using (I've shown System-V semantics
    under Bourne or Korn shells).

    [Hint for Sun OS users:  use /usr/5bin/echo instead of
    /bin/echo or Csh's built-in echo.  Otherwise you'll have
    to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string
    instead of using convenient octal sequences.]

    If you want your titlebar updated continously, say to show
    your current directory, hostname, or somesuch, then you'll
    have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out
    the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands.
    Sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence
    in the prompt string itself, sometimes not ...

Of course, just using the app context returned from

best option, unless that path is not available.

Hi,

I just got XFree86 running on my pc with Consensys and encountered a few
minor (I hope) probems.

The pc is hooked up to a LAN where I want remote X applications to 
connect to my X-server.  I believe the command to permit this is
xhost.  When I'm logged on my pc and type 'xhost + '  ,  I get the error message saying
"You must be on local machine to enable access". 
what does this mean ?  ain't I already on the local machine?

Another problem I have is with the mouse movement.  I find that the 
mouse cursor moves extremely slow and choppy.
How can I make the mouse cursor move more accurately?


thank in advance.
Any help is much appreciated.

please send replies to christy@alex.qc.ca.

Hi folks
Thanks to the ones that replied, however, my problem turned out
to be very simple.

In my .Xresources I had a space after XTerm*font:   10x20.
Removing this and xrdb fixed my problem.

Also, same symptom, was that some of my users did not have the
proper capitals for XTerm*font.

Thanks again

Bob

Can someone point me in the direction of any papers (not necessarily
formally conducted studies) discussing how much traffic X apps generate
for the network, particularly in comparison with curses-bases apps 
over telnet?  Also, does an X server typically buffer up user keyboard
input a line at a time?  Can the X client control this, asking for
keystrokes immediately?  Thanks in advance for any feedback!

I think the original post was searching for existing implementations of
f.i. Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain
X. Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie
where to get the latest version).
For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension
only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window
with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable
'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(),
what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes
or such stuff.

To speak about POVRay, the X previewer that comes with the original source
package is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness and
ICCCM compliance. Have a look on x256q, my own preview code. It is on

141.76.1.11:pub/gfx/ray/misc/x256q/

The README states the points where it is better than xwindow.c from
POVRay 1.0

Thanks for this clue, and thanks to Derek Ho also for a pointer in the
same direction.

One solution, due to Derek Ho: when the popup is popped up, we SetValue
its location -- which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the
previous popup. The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue
first, and only using SetValue if the required location is different.
The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the
location of the popup, so that the SetValue really does change the
location of the popup. (We tried this just for a double check on the
source of the problem.)

The solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows:

1) Use "twm" or "mwm" rather than "olwm"
2) Use "olwm", with resource "*wmTimeout: 10"
3) Only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed.

This is obviously working around some bug somewhere.

Thanks -- Chris Ho-Stuart

Keywords: Window Manager Focus Motif

     I am working on an X-Window based application that needs to 
override some of the window manager focus processing.  I am 
using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be 
working with Open Look in the future.

     What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the 
user from switching from one window of the application to 
another window.  Let's say, for example, that Window A is on top 
of Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks 
the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the 
window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain 
circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to 
beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window 
A.

      From the research and testing I've done so far, it appears that 
this window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this 
case Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default 
processing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell 
when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping 
notify events, but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the 
switch.

      The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very 
kludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch 
in those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force 
the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call 
and beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary 
functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places 
twice.

      Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any* 
window manager) when I don't want the window order switch to 
actually take place?  Respond either by e-mail or posting to this 
newsgroup.

Cheers....     Randall

I ran in to this problem I while ago, and from what I remember you should use
XtTranslateCoordinates etc. after realizing the main widget to calculate
the location of the popup, then use something like XtVaSetValues on the
popup widgets before ever using them.  Calling SetValues repeatedly (e.g.
every time something pops up) seems to be what slows you down.  I never
delved deep enough to figure out exactly why though...

Keywords: Frequency data X Server architecture

Hello--  I'm currently designing the architecture of a chip which is
intended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as
X.  A friend and I are designing the chip as the final course project for
an advanced computer architecture course taught by Dr. Fred Brooks at
UNC-Chapel Hill.  While we feel that we've got a pretty solid design
currently, we'd really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an
X-Windows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit
budget.  

Unfortunately, I've been unable to find anything of this sort in the
various X FAQs, or X manuals that I've seen.  Does anyone have some type of
frequency data, like how many Copy-rectangle operations vs draw-lines, and
things of that sort?  Or, barring that, a program that records requests to
the server into a logfile that I can munge on myself?

Any and all help would be very appreciated.

Many thanks,
    ---Mark

I *think* this is correct behavior.  Remember the default
colormapFocusPolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the
keyboard focus).  Since the dialog is modal, mwm won't allow keyboard
focus onto your main shell, and so it won't allow cmap focus either.

Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer, I
suggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way, the cmap
focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path.

(if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit, you can set cmap focus
explicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably on
MB1).

I am considering making a reasonably large application for free
distribution (probably copylefted).  I am going to use X.  Now I'm
bewildered by the huge number of "standards" that "open systems" has
created.  

I've lived in a fairly tookit-sheltered environment.  Most of the tools
here were produced with the Athena Widget set, or X Intrinsics or Xw
(??).  

In my humble opinion, they look like crap.  I don't know, however, if
this is a characteristic of the tookits, or just poor aestetic taste
in the programmers.

I would like my app to look a little more "sculptured" like mwm.  I
understand, however, that mwm isn't free like the other tookits.

I am getting Linux, so I will have InterViews, but I don't know how it
will look.  I get the impression Andrew is from the FSF, but I don't
know what it looks like either.

If you can help explain this toolkit mess to me, I would be much
obliged.  Which are free?  Which are the best?  Which are portable?  Which
looks nice?  Which is not a resource hog?

Also, if you happen to know which are available on Linux and/or Sun,
that would be a big help too.

Thanks in advance.

We have recently obtained a copy of color_xterm (from export.lcs.mit.edu) after
seeing it mentioned in a previous article. On compilation, it reports the
following undefined symbols:
	_get_wmShellWidgetClass
	_get_applicationShellWidgetClass

	but still runs. When sending escape sequences to set the colour,
any colour comes out as black text on a black background. Any Ideas?

Has anyone used this program in colour successfully?

Can anyone point me to any other colour terminal emulators?

We are running OpenWindows 3 on Sun Sparcs running SunOS 4.1.3.

Has anyone found a fix for the following problem?

Client Software:	SunOs 4.1.1, X11R5
Server Hardware:	Sun IPC
Server Software:	SunOs 4.1.1, Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37)

A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the
OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no
button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will
unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is
grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display
continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from
another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets
back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers
(including MIT X11R5 Xsun, DecWindows, Tektronix X terminal) has no
problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a
work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users.

I have tried the following things:

    1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch
       (100444-37).

    2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.

    3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110).
       This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of
       menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method), and
       screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help, but I
       was still able to get the application to hang.

Repeat By:

This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times.

Click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up)

Click and release on a menu item

Repeat until application hangs


Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Experiment: From a Sun openwindows 4.1.3 xterm window log into a
Solaris 2.x machine using rlogin; now do an "ls" and get the first
character of each line display in the last column of the display
with the rest of the line wrapped to the next line of the display.

Log out and the condition persists.  Check stty all, try reset
with no effect.

Use telnet instead of rlogin and it doesn't occur.

Try it from a unix console and it doesn't occur.

(1) What's causing this?
(2) Can it be avoided?
(3) How can the terminal characteristics be reset?

             I have a problem with icon pixmap. My application has to run
   under openwindow and motif. I wrote my program in Motif with pixmap and
   icons. It runs fine under motif/motif window manager and X11R5/mwm. But 
   the icon pixmap does not show up under openwin/olwm and X11R5/olwm.

             Has anybody got into this kind of problem? Need a clue. An 
   example which works in both X11R5/motif and openwindow will be great.

If you're on the internet and your site isn't sheltered from external
tcp/ip traffic, you can use the Remote Andrew Demo to see what the
Andrew Toolkit looks like:

Remote Andrew Demo Service

This network service allows you to run Andrew Toolkit applications
without the overhead of obtaining or compiling the Andrew software.  You
need a host machine on the Internet, and you need to be running the X11
window system.  A simple "finger" command will allow you to experience
ATK applications firsthand.  You'll be able to compose multimedia
documents, navigate through the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the
Andrew Message System to browse through CMU's three thousand bulletin
boards and newsgroups.

To use the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the following command
on your machine:

    finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu

The service will give you further instructions.

There is X for the Amiga, but it'll cost you.  GfxBase Inc., owned by
Dale Luck, one of the original Amiga architects, sells X for the Amiga.
There are many options available, including Motif.  Call 'em and get the

Not being an Xt programmer by any stretch of the imagination, this is
driving me crazy and it's probably really simple to do.

I need to make a composite widget that does nothing at all but is
merely a placeholder in a widget instance heirarchy -- allowing me an
additional resource name level.

To illustrate I have an application with the following widget
heirarchy:

	    Shell Widget
	         |
	Application Widghet

I want the following:

	    Shell Widget
	         |
	Intermediate Widget
	         |
	 Application Widget

where the intermediate widget has a name but gets all its other
properties (and propagates down new values) from the shell widget.

I assume there's a simple way to do this but I can't find an example
and the documentation I have is rather vague about implementing
composite widgets.

Please respond via email.  Any help will be very much appreciated.

 libXaw3d, the 3D Athena widget set will greatly improve the
"sculptured" look. In Linux, with its shared, jump-table libs, you
don't even have to recompile or relink. you merely have to:
 ln -sf /lib/libXaw3d.so.3.0 /lib/libXaw.so.3

I have a toggleButton widget (yes widget) and I have a routine
which changes the color of the foreground and background of the
label.  Well, the background changes alright, but the label
text does not redraw itself.

I am guessing that I have to force it to redraw with an
XExposeEvent sent to it via XSendEvent.  Is this the best
way to get the text up again?  I can't seeem to get
XSEndEvent to work right.... if this is a good approach,
might anyone have an example lying around to show me how to
do this?  I've RTFM all evening and did not find a decent
example.

PS I keep getting Segmentation Faults in XSEndEvent, tho all
the values are as expected.

Thanks in Advance

The following packages meet your criteria in that they are PD and
present an aesthetically pleasant graphical interface to the users.

If you can use 386bsd:
	there is xview3 (OpenLook)

	there is Interviews which looks a little like Motif

	there is gopath a very nice C++ toolkit for Athena Widgets and Motif
	         which is simpler
                 and better than interviews and you will enjoy
                 technical support from Bull via e-mail
		 It has a nice draw program (it uses motif) which can be used
		 to create graphical front-end to programs.
		 The data format is called streams which you can feed
		 to your programs. I ported gopath on an internet machine
		 which is gone but if you use gcc-2.3.3 with minimal effort
		 gopath can be ported to 386bsd.
		 Last but not least, gopath interfaces to toolkits via a driver
		 module. They have an MS-Windows driver module for instance.

	Also, many have written extensions to tk/tcl thus allowing powerful
	applications. For instance, tcl_nm  has snmp extensions for tk/tcl.
	With ease, I  can now combine snmp network operations with graphs,
	photo-widget, graphical interface, file operations, database 
	operations,etc.. The author of tcl_nm mail me a simple network 
	management application which was about 80 lines long - it displayed
	various environmental parameters from a router. I wrote  a simple
	strip chart script for displaying Real-Time ip received
	packets/seconds.


	Hope this helps,
	Amancio Hasty

While I cannot answer questions about running XDM over a DECnet, I can
say that the following defines must be added to the site.def before
building R5 before any X clients will work over a DECnet.

From site.def

#define ConnectionFlags -DTCPCONN -DUNIXCONN -DDNETCONN
#define ExtraLibraries -ldnet

Hoping this helps,

George

xvertext provides you with four functions to draw strings at any angle in   
an X window (previous versions were limited to vertical text). Rotation  
is still achieved using XImages, but the notion of rotating a whole font
first has been dropped.

What's new?

I've added a cache which keeps a copy of previously rotated strings - thus
speeding up redraws.

Is there a PD version of cfb, or other PD server stuff, which has a colour frame
buffer implementation which works in bitplaned mode, i.e. where the screen
memory is grouped so that "bit 0 of every pixel is here, bit 1 is there, etc."

The only such beast I know if at the moment is the GfxBase server for the
Commodore Amiga, and it is commercial. I don't know if they wrote their own cfb,
but I suspect they did.

Please respond by email, as I don't read this group.

Many thanks

I was planning to use the following pipe to move some display data to a system
that has a color hardcopy unit:

	xwd | xwud -display hostname:0.0

I had tested it with some simple windows like the OpenWindows file manager,
and it worked fine, but when I tried it with a more complex (larger) image,
the xwd part blew up with a segmentation fault.  I tried it without the pipe,
by redirecting xwd's output to a file and then used the file as input to xwud
and got the same error from xwud.  If I had to guess, it seems like it's
running out of memory, but this happened on a SPARC 10 with 64 megs, 128 meg
swap space, and only one user with minimal activity.  The file was about 3 MB.

This verion of xwd/xwud was supplied with the Sun OpenWindows 3.0 distribution
which I believe corresponds to X11 R4.

Any ideas?  Thanks in advance.

Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW.  We have several
Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on
several hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy, 
2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility,
4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely
operated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual 
manipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found 
it 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for
many protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle
TCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do
a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily
modified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems
by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.

Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and
SunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump.
It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will
need Motif 1.1 or better.

The following files are available for anonymous ftp from 
ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking

tcpview-1.0.tar.Z	tcpview and tcpdump source code
tcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z	Sun4 binaries
tcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z	DEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries

What tcpview adds to tcpdump:
- easier interface
- enhanced protocol decoding
- hex display of frame
- capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt
- can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name
- ethernet address host table
- can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames
- can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional
	processing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1

New features:

Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r', the 
file type will be automatically detected.

Can now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file.

The hex format has been changed.

New time options have been added.

Options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets.

Bugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag)

New flags:
-R	read Sniffer file.  Not usually needed, except for reading from stdin
-ttt	prints delta times
-tttt	prints times relative to the first frame
-W	write a Sniffer save file (use with -w)
-x	print frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.  
	Sample output:

16:36:23.349851 jeff.cac.washington.edu.1285 > nic.funet.fi.ftp: S 0:0(0) win 16384
        0000  45 00 00 28 8a 98 00 00 3c 06 7c 9c 80 5f 70 02   |  E..(....<.|.._p.

-X	print TCP data in hexdump format (used with -Z)
-z	write TCP data to stdout (use with -t to eliminate timestamp)

We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System.
The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n
facility. As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's 
X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit
uses Xsi.

Our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system.
In order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed
to character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with 
ASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t
array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout
and application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese',
each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.

We need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters
from the top are the same character set and what the character set is.

We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used
Xsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is the
source code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'.


//I18N.h
// This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*-
// $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $

#ifndef _I18N_H
#define _I18N_H

#include <X11/Xlib.h>

extern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,	/* IN */
				 int wc_len,		/* IN */
				 char *buf,		/* OUT */
				 int *buflen,		/* IN/OUT */
				 int *scanned_len,	/* OUT */
				 char **charset);	/* OUT */
extern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str);
extern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc);

#endif /* _I18N_H */

//I18N.cc
/* $Id: I18N.cc,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <X11/Xlibint.h>
#include <Xm/Xm.h>
#include "I18N.h"

extern "C" {
#include <X11/wchar.h>
#define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset
#define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs
#define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid
#include "Xlocaleint.h"
#undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset
#undef _Xmbfscs
#undef _Xmbctidtocsid
    extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int,
					 char*, int*, int*, int*);
    extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);
    extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID);
};

int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */
			  int wc_len,		/* IN */
			  char *buf,		/* OUT */
			  int *buf_len,		/* IN/OUT */
			  int *scanned_len,	/* OUT */
			  char **charset)	/* OUT */
{
    XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();
    int ctid;
    int status;
    Charset *xcharset;
    
    status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,
				       buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);
    if (status == Success) {
	xcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));
	*charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;
    }
    else
	*charset = NULL;
    return status;
}
----------------

An included file above, "Xlocaleint.h", is also Xsi internal and we copied
the file to the toolkit directory and compiled.

A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on
our HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.

When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit,
link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:
    _Xmbctidtocsid (code)
    _Xmbfscs (code)
    _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)
    _XFallBackConvert (code)

We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until
HP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that
because HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to 
know how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used 
its internal functions. 

The HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented.
We observe from HP's libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are
not sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and
therefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not
seem to lead us a solution.

My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like
'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to check
character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales?
If it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we
want to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5.

In order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machinery
to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for
the string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source 
files. We want to know how we can use that for our goal. 
Any help or comments would be highly appreciated.

I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area
even if it is not HP's implementation.

Thank you.

xdtm is working looking at, as is ftptool.  There really isn't anything of

As I've said before, there's no reliable way to find out the size of
the window manager decoration.  If your window has been reparented, you
can't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that
holds all of the window manager decoration.  There may be several
layers of windows.  Doing multiple XQueryTree's until you get to the
root will work in most cases, but there's no guarantee that the outside
decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm).

No, it isn't.  It is the "X Window System", or "X11", or "X" or any of
a number of other designations accepted by the X Consortium.  In fact,
doing "man X" on pretty much any X11 machine will tell you:

     The X Consortium requests that the following names  be  used
     when referring to this software:

                                  X
                           X Window System
                             X Version 11
                     X Window System, Version 11
                                 X11

There is no such thing as "X Windows" or "X Window", despite the repeated
misuse of the forms by the trade rags.  This probably tells you something
about how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME
of the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have 
to say?

With regard to dialup X11 implementations, there are several.  You can
buy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both 
GraphOn and NCD.  (In fact, I'm composing this from an NCD running X11
over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.)  

NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is
NCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such 
software packages available.

X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running
X11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and 
is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote. 

It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard, there
will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various 
sorts of hardware.

I'm just guessing here, but I'd guess that X11R5 expects the CG3 to have
1152x900 resolution, and the version of the CG3 in the SPARCclassic is 
1024x768.

fix the table in .../X11R5/mit/server/ddx/sun/ or
use xmodmap(1).

put
  stty pass8; setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1; setenv LESSCHARSET latin1
in your .login. the first prevents the stripping of bit 7.
the second sets the locale. the third makes less(1) show the character
instead of the octal representation.

Hi !

I am using Xview 3.0 on a Sparc IPX under Openwindows along with a XVideo board
from Parallax which enables me to use 24 bit color. I am having some problems
utilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter.

I use Xview to create a Frame and then create a canvas pane inside which I use
to display live video. My video input is 24 bit color.

The problem is that my top level frame created as
	frame = (Frame) xv_create(NULL,FRAME,NULL);
seems to have a depth of 8 which is propagated to my canvas.

I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits.
I tried using the following Xlib code :

XVisualInfo visual_info;
int depth = 24;
Colormap colormap;
XSetWindowAttributes attribs;
unsigned long valuemask = 0;
Window *win;
Xv_opaque frame;

win = xv_get(frame,XV_XID);
XMatchVisualInfo(display,screen,depth,TrueColor,&visual_info);

/* So far so good */

colormap = XCreateColormap(display,win,visual_info,AllocNone);

/* It dies here with a BadMatch error :( */

attribs.colormap = colormap;
valuemask |= CWColormap;
XChangeWindowAttributes(display,w,valuemask,&attribs);
XSetWindowColormap(display,win,colormap);


Am I using a completely wrong approach here ? Is it possible to set the depth
and colormap for a window created by Xview ? What am I doing wrong ?

Thanks in advance for any help that I can get. I would prefer a response via
email although a post on the newsgroup is also okay.

Thanks again,


Alok.

Hi Guys,

	It has been a long time since I wrote a program using X. I am trying to 
	get myself re-familiarize with X. I would appreciate your help regarding
	the following problem.

	I am trying to compile a simple X program on sun running sunOS 4.1.2. 
	using
	cc -o ex ex.c -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm
	I am getting an error

	ld: Undefined symbol
		_get_wmShellWidgetClass
		_get_applicationShellWidgetClass


 The simple program I tried to compile is given below.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>
#include <X11/StringDefs.h>
#include <X11/Xaw/Form.h>

main(argc,argv)
int 	argc;
char	**argv;
{
	Widget	topLevel;
	Widget	frame;

	topLevel = XtInitialize("ex","Ex",NULL,0, &argc,**argv);
	frame = XtCreateManagedWidget("Form",formWidgetClass,topLevel,NULL,0);
	XtRealizeWidget(topLevel);
	XtMainLoop();
}




	I got the same error when I tried to build "xpostit" using the Imakefile
	provided with the software.

	I have compiled X programs before (not on this machine, but on other 
	machines running sunOS 4.0 and X11 R4). I did not get this error message
	Can anybody tell me why I am getting these messages.

	I would appreciate if you can email your responses to me at
	azn30@ruts.ccc.amdahl.com.

	Thanks
	Anand

There are several products you might investigate.  If you've got
$20,000 per seat and high-end hardware, Gain Momentum might be a good
choice.  It isn't compatible with HyperCard, but has a similar
architecture (and *way* more functionality).  I don't have contact
information, but they were recently purchased by Sybase who shouldn't
be too hard to find.

If you're running News on SPARC, check out HyperLook
(hyperlook@turing.com).  It uses Postscript as a scripting language
which is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting,
but not so good for non-programmers.  It was $995, last I heard.

You might also look at our product MetaCard.  We're alpha-testing
direct importing of HyperCard stacks (we've even made the test release
available for anonymous FTP), so we're obviously the closest in
functionality.  MetaCard runs on most UNIX workstations and costs
$495.  Email to info@metacard.com for more details.

I'd appreciate any feedback on capture/playback tools for use with X clients.

I have pulled XTM from public domain but it appears to be set up to test
X servers not X clients. 

Any comparisons/comments on regression testing tools would be great -
particularly XTM, XRunner, Autotester, and SRI's CAPBAK, SMARTS and EXDIFF.
