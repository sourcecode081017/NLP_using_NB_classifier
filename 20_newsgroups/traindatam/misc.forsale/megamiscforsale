I think the problem with small claims court is that you have to go to
the location of the person you're taking action against.  It seems to
me the time and money involved in travelling out there (unless this
person is close to you) wouldn't be worth it for a small claim.
It really depends on how much money you're out.

If I am wrong about any of this, someone please correct me! ;)

                            RESIDENTIAL LOT FOR SALE





               I have a nice residential lot available.  It is approx-
          imately 1/2 acre in size.  It is located in the development
          called Belvedere Plantation in Pender County, eastern North
          Carolina, north of Wilmington.  The lot is near the Intra-
          Coastal Waterway.  Golf and tennis are located on the
          development property.  Belvedere Plantation also has a mar-
          ina facility on the ICW.  This lot is nearby to all of the
          facilities mentioned.



               I own the lot outright but it does not look like I will
          get back to the area anytime soon.  I would like to sell it
          for that reason.  Make an offer.



               If interested please send E-mail.

I have one round-trip ticket good for travel between USA or Canada and
Europe, Hawaii, Latin America, or the Caribbean.  It is fully transferable 
and can be used originating here or there.

I had intended  to use it to visit my grandfather who was sick, but he died 
before I got there so I have no use for it now.

I'm looking for $500 or best offer, but act fast it will be gone on April 15
no matter what.

        The NeXT Book, by Bruce Webster (New Copy)

        Black NeXTconnection modem cable
        30 HD disks (10 still in unwrapped box, others for backing up
            apps)

I NEED to sell this pronto to get a car (my engine locked up)!
Machine runs great... only used in my house.  Has been covered when
not in use on the days I wasn't around.

$2,300 INCLUDING Federal Express Second Day Air, OR best offer, COD to
your doorstep (within continental US)!!  I need to sell this NOW, so
if you don't agree with the price, make an offer, but within reason.
;)

Thanks,
JT

      Sony D-22 portable Diskman forsale
      
      Good condition, flawless.
      
      Costomer AC adapter : 6v DC power supply ( tested 9v DC)
       
       * The factory adapter was tested 12v DC (AC 110v input) at the 
         time I bought it three years ago. When using it, a lot of heat 
         was generated inside the CD machine. Of course I wouldn't use 
         it to risk this baby's life. Maybe that's why so many owners 
         always complain about their portable machine going kaput after 
         a short time usage.

Not to mention the thread about selling someone's wife. I am a guy, therefore
not overly bummed by it, but a little common sense would dictate that this
is offensive to many women, and not really necessary.

I'm looking for a Sharp 6220 or TI Travelmate 2000 for parts.  Mine has
a bad RAM chip on the motherboard and I want to see what I can get for
parts before sending it off to Sharp for repairs.  If you have one,
drop me a line.

Also, I'm trying to set one up for a friend who needs to read his old
5 1/4 inch diskettes.  Anyone have the pinout of the diskette expansion
connector on the back of the 3.5 inch floppy box? 

If you respond, please include a phone number. I can't always get through 
with email.
 
As always, 

Thanks,

Jim Lewczyk

	Good point, but I was just thinking.. I wanted to sell my HP28sx
calculator here in this newsgroup... It is called a calculator, but really
it is a computer, albeit a small one, but it does function as one... How
come car adds are acceptable? They cant run without computers nowadays....
Where does one draw the line? Accept it, live with it, and if you care to,
avoid it....

  What about the St. Pat. posters from last year?  I have a stack of about 
twenty, and two of the card-board cutouts.  (No, they are NOT for sale, I

Hi, everyone;


I need an advice on what is the best way to get a scumster.

Several weeks ago I posted an article on behalf of a friend who wanted
an external HD for mac. The scumster - R.E.P. - called my friend and
they agreed on a price. My friend (unexperienced and not too fluent in
English) paid by check, requesting R.E.P. to call him back when the check
arrives and the HD is send. Well, the check was cashed 3/24 and that is
that. Phone # that R.E.P. gave is on the answering machine all the time
and there is no reaction when the message is left; e-mail address does not
bounce but again there is no answer. I know, that R.E.P. is a student at
University of Delaware; I have his e-mail address, his US postal address
and his (?) phone#. The question is: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED?

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Sincerely,
Victor Levenson (VVL2H@virginia.edu)

P.S. The reason I did not put R.E.P.'s full name is that I still hope...


P.P.S. If I get enough responses I will post a summary, maybe even on a
regular basis.

Mind my asking why you're selling a used machine with a damaged
keyboard for the about the same price as a brand new A4000/030
(A4000-EC030/4 megs/120meg IDE HD/HD Floppy/v3.0 OS - $1899)?

I'd like to get an A3000 locally for something reasonable like less
than 1K without monitor.  Brand new the A3000-25mhz/50 meg HD/HD
floppy/2.1 ROM isn't running for more than $1400 or so.

Considering it's damaged, probabably has a real old version of the OS
I'll offer $700.  Don't laugh...my A2000 isn't worth more than
$250-$300 these days.

I was wrong! I guess they are closer to $800 new! I will
probably still sell them for the above implied $300 obo.

    Got a few things I want to get rid of...

    Paradise EGA480/Casper EGA Monitor

    1 12 MHz '286 motherboard (DRAM/SIPP)
    1 16 MHz '286 momboard (DRAM only)

    1 Hayes "Prodigy special" 2400b external modem

    1 1Meg SIPP
    1 256K SIPP

    about 2 Megs DRAM (I believe there's 1M of 120ns, and one of 100 or
    80ns, but not absolutely sure).

    Also have an XT with 640K, serial board, Hercules board and amber
    monitor.  The only thing this system is missing is the power supply.


    Make an offer on any/all of this stuff, and thanx for contributing
    to Mitch's V.32bis modem fund.


        Mitch

According to reports, if you don't have DOS yet, and don't have any
utilities (QEMM, Stacker, PCTools, Norton, ...) then DOS6 may be worth it. 

For people who have DOS5, and some sort of utility, DOS6 doesn't offer
much. You'd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able
to create, however. :-)

Hey!  I am interested in buying a digital delay pedal, preferably
capable of sampling and infinite repeat.  (If you're familiar
with Phil Keaggy, I want to mimic, or at least as close as possible,
what he does in concert, i.e., click the pedal, play something, click
it again, and what he played between clicks repeats infinitely while
he playes leads over it)  Anyway, let me know.....

Just to inform the readers of newsrc Sony has just introduced a new DATman,
the TCD-D7 which is smaller and less expensive than the D3.  Also, the D7
has a coaxial jack which the D3 lacks.  Oh, the D3 has always been
available through mail-order houses for less than $700 dollars new... with
the new model coming out, I suspect the now obsolete D3 will be selling for 
even less.

I'm looking for a used/inexpensive audio mixer.  I need at least 
4 channels of stereo input and 1 channel of stereo output, but I would
prefer 8 or more input channels.  Each channel needs to have at least a 
volume control.  I'll consider buying broken equipment.  The mixer needs 
to be fairly small (I haven't got a lot of space for it).

I'll third the opinion about this outfit/franchise. Now, when I
buy over the net and pick up the shipping costs, I'll specify that I
only pick up the normal UPS charges (as if delivered directly to
UPS), as I've been burned by $10 shipping charges for a $2.49 pkg.
I will never use a mailing service unless I don't have the
right box and the buyer needs whatever IMMEDIATELY. I'll also
tell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on.

Other things to watch out for/consider:

	The rates are $5 to $30 higher than UPS direct.

	For a non-UPS (truck) package, they quoted a rate
	of $85. Fed Ex economy air was only $85 for the
	same weight! RPS (a trucking package company, in many
	cities) only wanted $18. Guess who got it. The Mailbox
	operator told me I was not telling the truth about
	competitors' rates, said RPS was unreliable (I've used them
	before with NO problems), etc. Right.

	A COD check goes to the mailing service. Our local
	Mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the
	remade check. All this for an additional $3.00 over the
	UPS COD charge. What a deal.... :-)

	For packages over $100, they charge you about double over
	what UPS charges them for insurance. I've never had
	a claim, but other netters (is Ralph Seguin out there?)
	have told horror stories about them...

	All package traces have to be done through Mailbox by
	Mailbox.

	Our local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I
	asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared
	to direct UPS. Does he ever check? Probably not...

	Their UPS ground rates come close to Fed Ex's economy
	air rate, and Fed Ex will pick up!

	UPS will pick up for a $5 charge in most areas!

          I  am  cleaning  out  the coffers.  I have a virtually 
          MINT collection of HEAVY METAL magazine.  This is  NOT 
          a  music  mag  but the really neato mag with Giger and 
          Moebius  artwork,  et  al.  Jam  packed  with  amazing 
          sci-fi  and  fantasy artwork by many masters.  All are 
          mint with the exception of the 3 that have split  seam 
          on  the  cover  only but are otherwise perfect, no cut 
          outs or missing pages.  I have Sep, Nov and Dec issues 
          for 1978, ALL issues for 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982,  1983 
          and  Jan  thru  Sep  for  1984  (72  issues  in  all i 
          believe).  I will not break  them  up.  They  will  be 
          sold  as  a  single  lot.  Send  your  offers  to  me. 
          Shipping not included,  these  are  pretty  heavy.  Of 
          course  if  you are local (Mass, USA) you can come get 
          'em in person.

	IMHO, it seems to be worth the $40 to upgrade.  DoubleSpace seems a bit 
saner than Stacker 2.0 (which I've replaced).  MemMaker is nowhere near as 
aggressive as QEMM, but it doesn't hose my system like QEMM did (at least
it hasn't yet).  Microsoft AntiVirus is just the latest version (or a 
reasonably recent one) of CPAV - mine was very aged, so this was quite welcome.

 	MS-DOS 6.0 ain't the end all, be all of operating systems - but it's
better than a sharp stick in the eye, unless you happen to be into that sort 
of thing.  :-)

If anyone's still interested, I have ONE Mattel electronic game left for sale
or trade. It's Baseball (Tan Case) and includes a 9-volt battery and the
original manual!  I was able to sell Soccer and Basketball 2 for $70.00 and
traded the Football game for a Genesis cart...  so, I was happy.  I will
entertain all offers.. cash or Genesis carts...  By the way, Baseball is in
Excellent condition and works perfectly..

Jammer !

 Dit is geen fantastische advertentie over nep-rolexen
 maar een evenzo duidelijke mededeling hieromtrent :

 Aangezien het alleen al aanbieden van deze horloges onder
 vermelding van de echte merknaam niet geheel correct is,
 wil ik met dit bericht duidelijk maken dat ik, Marcel Engelbertink,
 niet meer zal adverteren met imitatie-horloges van het merk ROLEX.

 Enig persoon die hierin geiinteresseerd is kan ik jammer genoeg ook niet
 meer helpen.




 For all the foreign people who can't even understand dutch ?!? :

 In spite of earlier mailing about fake-rolex's, I announce that I
 don't have any information available any longer and I won't use
 the trade name ROLEX anymore for those fake models.


 Yours fakefully,

IRWIN suggests the use of pre-formatted tapes for their tape drives, as
you often can't successfully format a tape and need  bulk-erase it before
you can format it again. Anyway, I have some new, preformatted tapes for
IRWIN 250 tape drives. 
IRWIN accuTRAK series 120-250MB, $16/ea. New never used.
3M DC2120, RHOMAT Format.  $16/ea. Wraped.

Forsale:

Proton P1100 preamplifier
========================= About 3.5 years old, originally $299, asking $150
or best offer.  Has inputs for tape 1, tape 2, CD, phono, video and tuner.
Separate listen and record selectors.  Bass EQ, subharmonic filter and mono
switch.  High quality volume potentiometer.  In excellent condition, with
original boxes and manual.

Sony D-88 portable Diskman
========================== This is the one designed to play the mini CD's.
You can play normal size CDs, but the disk sticks out the side.  Works
well,
but may skip occasionally - it should be tuned up (heads aligned, cleaned,
etc.)  In excellent condition.  It has not been used all that much.  With
carrying case.  Original list was (I think) $300, but I'll take $80 or best
offer.  It would be good for an office or just to sit on your desk.

Hi,

	I have a Humminbird HDR200 Depth Sounder for sale. It
has been used for 1 season on my sailboat. 
	
	All parts are included as well as the installation
instructions. It is even packed in the original box it came in. There
is no damage to the unit or the transducer. In fact, the transducer
was mounted *inside* the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull.
So it led a "sheltered" life. The transducer can be mounted either inside
the hull as I did, or on the transom. It cannot be placed in a hole
drilled into your hull.

	It is fully waterproof and fits into a 2" hole in a bulkhead
(that's where I had it installed) or into a standard dashboard on a
powerboat. It reads depth to 199' and has a backlit LCD display. It has
an adjustable shallow water alarm built in. 

	I am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that
outputs the NMEA 0183 information. This little depth sounder works fine
and is very stable.


	It is usually priced as low as 130$ in some catalogs, I paid 150$.


	The first 80$ takes it, or best offer.

Sorry to waste the bandwidth. Does anyone know a software mail order company 
called "Software Unlimited"? I ordered a software from them and they charged my
credit card but never did send the package to me.

I call them many times but nobody answer the phone. I also check Computer
Shoppers and found they don't advertise anymore. If you know if they are still
in business or you know how to contact them, please tell me.

Thank you very much.

He is probably referring to the DOS version.. the dos versions is up
to like version 6 i think.  The window version just came out recently
so it is only up to like version 2 or something.

do not pay $40 for floppy drives.. they are about $40 new.
also, you do not need documentation for floppies. installation
for these things are idiot proof. 
just some advice..

i installed dos 6 last week, and had nothing but trouble afterwards.
windows apps are hitting protection faults more than a kid can do 
to a pinata, and it does not seem to like to work with NDOS (norton 
dos 7.0).  other probs include:

set pcplus=d:\pcplus for procomm plus no longer works.
many of the little utilities to written for dos no longer works
	either. (mostly shareware)

i now have uninstalled dos 6 , and dos 5 works just fine.
are there any apps that dos 6 will be able to run that dos 5 wont?

Looking to save money?  I am your man.  I will mail you 
$5 in food coupons for only$2.50.  Or you will get twice the dollar amount
of coupons.  So mail $15 and get $30 dollars in coupons. Sounds like a great
deal well it is.  Send SASE to 766 S.Elizabeth St. Salt Lake City, Utah 84102
enclose money in form of a money order.  Personally, I would not trust a person
to send coupons after money is sent.  Well, let me earn your trust.  Send
$1 dollar, and I'll send you your $2 in store coupons.  
Then we'll talk more

	It's an experiment, place a not so subliminal, slightly

	It was the same thing with the "Blow me" message, only it had a

For Sale ...:
 
        Hewlett Packard DeskJet 500 inkjet printer.
 
        o Perfect condition both internally and externally
        o Comes with two FULL ink cartridges
        o Less than six months old
        o Comes with all original packaging, manuals, cables
          and software
 
        This is truly an excellent printer and is the low-cost
        alternative to a laser printer.  It prints with the
        quality of a laser printer, but for a fraction of both
        the inital cost and he long term cost (that is,
        replacement of ink cartridges as opposed to replacement
        of toner).  The printer prints at a maximum of 300*300
        (D)ots (P)er (I)nch (D.P.I.) on many different types
        and sizes of paper, including envelopes and
        transperencies.  Printer prints in both landscape and
        portrait modes.  Printer can accept up to two
        cartridges giving it things like more memory or
        additional fonts.  Printer works excellently with
        Windows and DOS and brings TrueType to its full
        potential.
 
        I originally purchased the printer for $375.00.  Make me
        an offer, but I would prefer to stay in the $300.00
        range.  I will pay the shipping to anywhere in the 
        continental U.S.A.
 
        If you are interested, please either leave me email or
        call Kirk Peterson at (303) 494-7951 anytime.
 
        Thanks!
 


        P.S. The printer will work with any computer that
             can accept a standard parallel or serial
             connection.  (That is, IBM, Amiga, etc.)

********************[ PC Game For Sale ]******************

Waxworks by Horrorsoft/Accolade (5.25")		   $30

By the same folks who brought you Elvira I & II.  I played
Elvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made
a very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is
roughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time
fighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games,
especially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to
stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This 
is not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is
quite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found
that is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting
strategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is 
no fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain
moderately challanging puzzles.

The really interesting thing about this game is that it is really 
broken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits
you must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported
with no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps
you inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must 
escape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit
traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines
and pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant
zombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue
some humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill
the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is
perhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into
Jack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper
victim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must
avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and 
meet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit
pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to 
stop the almost indestructible zombies.  

Over all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a 
creepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though
gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.
I heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.

Oh, dear.  Let me be the first on my block.

You have just violated one of the major shibboleths of the Usenet groups:
you're not supposed to use a newsgroup to plug your own commercial
enterprise (of _any_ kind; people frequently get flamed for announcing
they've got a new book out.)

I don't know whether this is an official Usenet rule or just a long-
standing custom, and it doesn't make much difference from a practical
point of view.

So please don't do it again.

And all you others, who are even now taking keyboard in hand to flame
him off the face of the earth--lay off.  He didn't know any better.

I don't want him nuked, I want him to be honest.  The junk mail has
been much more interesting than the promised catalog.  If I'd known
what I was going to get, I wouldn't have hesitated.  I wouldn't be
surprised if there were other folks who looked at the ad and said
"nope" but who would be very interested in the junk mail that results.
Similarly, there are people who wanted the advertised catalog who
aren't happy with the junk they got instead.

The folks buying the mailing lists would prefer an honest ad, and
so would the people reading it.

Hello Neo-Geo owners (and non-owners who couldn't resist the title;)),

I was wondering if any of you out there want to trade or sell games.  I
mean, buying them from the stores can get kinda expensive.  $184.99 is
a little too much to be spending on each game.  But ahh, the quality...
Now I can get them for about $100, but that's still a lot.

Right now, I have:

Crossed Swords
Magician Lord
Baseball Stars 2
Fatal Fury
Nam-1975

I am interested in buying more titles.  If any of you have any interesting
trade ideas, please let me know.


Thanks

Tom

Heise model 710A pressure meter. This is a precision 4-1/2
digit meter measuring 0 - 15 PSI (absolute) in .001 psi
increments.  Case is in extremely good shape, and can be used
as a stand-alone meter or panel mounted. Brass fitting (looks
like standard 3/8") on back. Operates from 110 VAC.

I'd like $50 for it, or make an offer. It is a lot more useful to
a lab than as an ersatz barometer, which is what I've been using
it for.

Hello,
  I am looking for the Coleco Tablehockey games that were popular
in the 70's.  The games that I seek have straight slots for the
defenseman, not the S shaped slots.  The players are attatched to
rods operated with springs.  If you have a game(or games) that
you would be willing to part with, please send me an e-mail
message at U34815@uicvm.uic.edu.  Price is negotiable and
I would also cover shipping if you are out of state.  I am
part of a league that plays on a regular basis, the CTHL (The
Chicago Table Hockey League), and need a game to practice on.
Also, the league itself is always interested in purchasing
games to expand itself.
                                  Thank You,
                                         Ken Harris.

Tickets midweek are now down to $34.  They will be $25 starting last
week in April, or maybe first week in May.  By the way, the current
conditions (was there Apr 12-13) are great for spring skiing, with
excellent coverage, most stuff open, and no lift lines.

1976 BMW 530i

The original four door sports sedan


Arctic Blue metallic with gold alloy plus-1 wheels (Rial 15")
Goodyear Eagle GT+4 racing tires (mud/snow-rated)
3.0 liter, 186 HP, fuel injected engine w/Stahl headers
adjustable gas shocks all around (Koni,BYK)
4 speed stick, 4 wheel power disc brakes, sunroof, PS, AC
Listen-Up installed hidden speaker stereo w/subwoofer

208K miles (yet much better condition than most cars w/100K)
Meticulously maintained: all records, 3K mi oil changes
Faded paint on top, otherwise excellent exterior and interior.

The car has required no major repair work in the more than ten years I have
owned it. It has never failed to start or broken down, even in the coldest
weather. This has been an extraordinarily reliable and economical car, and
shows every sign of staying that way. Yet it is an absolute thrill to drive
when you take it to secluded twisty mountain road! I sell it now,
reluctantly, since I just succumbed to the convertible craving and bought a
new Miata.

Greetings:

Here is a list of items for the 3B1 which I am selling:

dBase III - Full dBase III multiuser Development/Runtime for 3B1!
Microsoft Basic Interpreter - Gives 2.5 Megabytes RAM available!
Microsoft Word - Full featured mouse-based multiuser word-processor.
Microsoft MultiPlan - Nice multiuser spreadsheet program. 
GSS-Chart - Nice graphical program for creating business charts.
LPI-C - A robust C compiler.  I'll throw in LPI-DEBUG:single-step,alter vars.
AT&T Electronic Mail - Very nice Office-based front end to mail.

I'll take $500 or best offer for the whole bunch.  I bought all of these
new in 1985, and paid over $2,000 for these excellent programs.

I'd rather sell them together, but don't hesitate to make me an offer for one.

I'd consider possible trades.  I'm interested in the following 3b1 Hardware:

Ethernet Card with or without Software
Tape Backup
External Expansion Unit
Upgraded P5.1 motherboard (Or just info on who can do the P5.1 upgrades)
ICUS 2nd hard drive upgrade kit
AT&T 513bct, 610, 615, or 4415 terminals with the UNIXPC-style keyboard

Make me an offer.

PS:  I can get UNIX PCs with 40M Drives and 1M Motherboards loaded with 3.51m,
cnews, smail, trn, rn, elm, nethack, gzip, HDB, and a couple other things
for about $550 each plus shipping.  Let me know if you're interested.

PPS:  Priam D519 150M Hard Drives (Exactly same as Maxtor 2190, but faster)
are on sale for $280 thru a vendor in LA (Number not handy, write for info)
This is a VERY good price for these drives, the largest, fastest HDs
available for the UNIX PC.  (Note, to fully use the entire 150M, you'll
need the P5.1 motherboard upgrade [WHO DOES THESE?], and a WD2010)

It really doesn't strike me as very funny. It is rather indicative of what
a crisis their economy is in. I imagine they are in desparate need of
markets to sustain industries and people which are nolonger under central
control of the government.

My girlfriend switched to gas-permeable hard lenses and no longer
needs a one year old soft contact lens cleaning unit.  It's one of
those where you pop in the lens case filled with solution and the
lenses, press the lighted timer button and let it cook.  No stains
(of course -- if you've owned one of these, you understand), maybe
a little dust on the cover.

Best cash offer, or equivalent worth in used CD's or Betamax tapes
(some blanks or a couple of pre-recorded movies/concerts).

My company maintains a 20,000+ mailing list which is regularly rented for
one time use by the major software companies.  The method you are using to
"seed" your junk mail, isn't really effective.  Bulk mailers regulary 
either send their databases to be "cleaned" by the NCOA, which if you've
moved recently, will revert back to the original "xxx Cool", and in large
mailings, there will likely be a dupe of you, and they'll pick the first, and use the
others for future mailings.
 
BTW, our list is currently one of the hottest lists for actual buyers of
a MS Windows utility product in the $100 range, and is available through
Direct Media in CT., at $0.10 per name.  Please let your direct mail
marketing rep. know about this..  Thanks.

For sale:  Precision drafting machine, Bruning OGP-0180.  Solid
older model with spring-loaded counter balance; clamps on table.  Without
scales.  For right handed person.  $60/make offer, includes UPS/parcel post 
postage.

I'm guessing that it's from the 1940s or 1950s, a period well known for 
excellent drafting machine construction! :-)
It's built with real metal parts, not cheap modern plastic, and it's painted 
the typical office grey popular in that period.  It's smooth working, and 
each of the two "arms" on it measures roughly 24".  It has a dual clamp to 
enable you to clamp it on the edge or corner of a table.

I have used JVC's top of the line portable cd player for three months now.
I have mostly used it in my car on long trips, so it has less than 20 hours of use on it.  The unit is one of the best that I have seen and listened to, but
I am going to part with it to install a disc changer in my car.

Features include:
	17 Hz - 20,000 Hz
	rechargeable nicad batteries
	wireless remote control
	AC adaptor
	headphones
	carrying belt and case
	digital 6 band graphic eq with spectrum analyzer
		25 presets, 5 user programmable
	RCA connections and cord
	JVC compulink capability (cord included)
	programmable from remote
	intro, random, repeat playback

I will include a Discwasher (tm) power converter to convert an automobile's
12v DC to the 5.5V DC that the unit requires.  I had to buy this one because
it was the only one that fits, (JVC makes a unique connection that cannot be
found at Radio Shack etc).

I paid $235 for the disc player and another $30 for the power converter.
I will sell the disc player alone for $180, or both items for $190.

Hello,

      While refurbishing our observatory I came across the above mentioned camera. It was manufactured
by the Instrument Corporation of Florida  ~ 1970. Now for my questions:

1) Does anyone have any knowledge of this equipement ?
2) Does anyone know of the company (phone numbers ?) ?
3) Are there any others out there...I need some parts.


Any responces are greatly appreciated.

                                                 take care,
                                                         jamie

I hope you realize that for a cellular phone, you need to subscribe to a
Cellular carrier, and it usually takes at least one working day before
the service is available to you. Only then you can find out whether 
the phone is working.

Hello, I have a motherboard and a case for sale as a package.
Both of them came from a CompuAdd computer I bought last August and am 
  presently upgrading.
Here are the specs--

Motherboard
-----------
Cyrix 486SL 25 MHz microprocessor
Chips and Technology chipset (SCATsx V2.3.6 SLSLC)
8 SIMM banks for a maximum of 32 Megs of RAM
BUILT-IN Floppy and Hard Drive Controllers
BUILT-IN ports--1 Parallel, 2 Serial (9 and 25 pin)
BUILT-IN Paradise SVGA controller with 1 meg of RAM (Windows drivers inc.)
   -can do up to 1024x768 @ 256 colors
   -based on the Western Digital WD90C31 chip
Math co-processor slot
3 16-bit expansion slots and 2 8-bit expansion slots

Case
----
Low-Profile Desktop
Very nice grey color
150 watt power supply
Room for 2 floppies plus HD

Mouse
-----
3-button
Microsoft-compatible
Grey color matches case

All original manuals and documentation, video drivers, etc. are included.

You are probably wondering why I must sell the case with the motherboard.
It is simply because the case is custom-made for this particular board and
  you would be hard-pressed to fit another MB in it.  However, the case and
  this motherboard were made to go together and fit perfectly.

As you can see, since this board includes drive controllers AND a video 
  controller, you can save some money by buying this unit and not a MB
  where you would need to get IO cards, video card, and drive controllers
  Its just a lot more convenient on the whole

I would like to ask about $500 for this whole package.  I think this is a fair
  price given the facts that it includes a video card and drive controllers/IO
  ports.  All you need to do is add drives, a monitor, RAM, and a keyboard. 
  Also keep in mind that it isn't a generic board, but from CompuAdd.
I also will entertain all serious offers.

Please email at jmu@acpub.duke.edu

Thanks

I'd be surprised if you couldn't find a gov't aid program to

Okay, okay, Norman himself isn't actually for sale.  BUT:

I have two Saturday Even Post's, both of which have Norman Rockwell
illustrations on the front cover.

October 29, 1960  --  with candidate Kennedy on campaign
   -- has, obviously, a Norman Rockwell of Kennedy on the cover

November 5, 1960  --  with candidate Nixon on campaign
   -- And here we have Nixon.  He's not a crook...

These are both in very good condition.
Let me know if you're interested, and to what tune.  ($$)

This is the final public update to my dragon magazine auction.  If there
are no new bids then the current bids stand (like that's gonna  happen.  :) ).
After this, any updates will be by E-mail *ONLY*.  The entire auction 
will end as soon as the bids stop coming in.  So if you want to get in
on  this, be sure to bid now.  All bids must be made in *AT LEAST*
25 cent increments.  Buyer will pay shipping.  (Unless you have any
particular fancy, it will be US mail 4th class special, with lots of
padding).  
All dragons are bagged.  The condition of them vary quite a bit, 
so I've come up with my own condition system.  Some dragons may be missing 
items like the inserts.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
*
Condition ratings - Usually this is just an evaluation of the cover, as
most of the material inside is in great shape.
Excellent - IE-"As you find them in the store"
Very Good - Still in great condition, but can tell it's been boughten
Good      - On down the line
Very Fair/fair - indicates lots of use (But still "decent")
Poor      -  Indicates the material inside may be damaged (usually by
scissors).  
A * by the condition indicates that something from the magazine is

Not true.  Dial 811 and listen to the recording.  If you get it, then your 
phone was recognized by the network.  You wouldn't be able to dial a real

Looking for an amateur radio operator that needs a variable power linear
amplifier for 2-30MHz.  Looks and works like new.  Runs off 12v for mobile
use.  Input: 5-10 watts  Output: ~175 watts AM, ~350 watts PEP SSB.
I need $150 out of it.

If that's too much, I also have a Tornado 100 that takes 5w in and
100/250w out for $100.

Reply with your callsign, address and phone number for verification of license.

Prices do NOT include shipping/packaging.

        33 - Who Mourns for Adonais?

Numbers indicate episode numbering on the tape boxes, for those who
are keeping track of what episodes they're missing in that manner.

RSVP for summaries, if necessary.

The tapes are all in excellent condition in the original packaging.
All have been played at least once, but most have been played ONLY
once, and NONE have been played more than twice. Running time: ~50
min. ea.  (Unedited, uncut store-bought originals unlike those in
syndication; all have *incredible* Beta HiFi sound!)

I also have the following SF and Horror movies on Beta as well; US$10
(negotiable) or Trade (1-for-1 swap for movie on Beta or a used CD):

        The Bride (Sting, Jennifer Beales)
*       Buck Rogers Conquers the Universe (Buster Crabbe, Constance Moore)

RSVP for my larger Beta movies/music trade list, or find it on Misc.forsale!

PS: For those of you who may wonder, Beta is alive as a pro/hobbyist
format ... there's life beyond the corner video store! (-;

I need some used scanners.  I'm limiting my selection to HP models
with document feeders.  I think this means the ScanJet Plus and the
ScanJet IIc.

so...if you have one of these and want to sell it, please tell me.

--kyler

P.S.  I need only one with a Mac interface; the others are for IBM-PC
compatibles.

	I will be in Boston (Cambridge specifically) working this summer
and am in need of a place to stay. If you have a room to sublease, or
anything of the sort I would appreciate a mail.
I am a 20-year old white male and am very flexible. I can adapt to a smoking
or non-smoking environment. Access to the 'T' would be nice, though I will 
have a car thus need a parking space. 
I would need this from late May or early June until aproximately end of July.
Any responses welcome.

I would like to sell my dot matrix printer so I can upgrade to inkjet.
It is a "Panasonic KX-P1124 24 pin Multi-Mode Printer".  Here are the
stats (from memory and the manual):

-  360x360 dot-printing for hi-res graphics, etc.
-  VERY fast (up to 192 cps) printing in "printer-controlled" (as
	opposed to Windows driver-controlled) printing
-  Bidirectional printing for faster processing speed
-  5 fonts ("courier","prestige","bold ps","script","sans serif")
-  Epson LQ-2500 and IBM Proprinter X24 printer emulation
-  Can accept single sheets, envelopes, and 3 non-carbon copies by
	friction feed
-  Front or bottom paper feed
-  6KB buffer

I will send a sample document and a printed GIF/JPEG file to anyone
who wishes to send a SASE.  With purchase (prepaid, please!), I will
include the following accessories:

-  Manual
-  cable (Centronics)
-  remaining stack of tractor-fed paper (about .4")
-  FREE copy of Windows printer driver (unless this is illegal, or if
	it is included with Windows)
-  FREE unregistered DOS shareware program ($2 registration, I think)
	that apparently offers some word processing capabilities
	from DOS

The last two will be on a disk (either size).  I am asking for around
$165, but I am open to any (reasonable) offers.  I am a college
student, so I cannot afford to buy a new printer without getting a
considerable portion of the money from this printer.  This price
includes all above items, and shipping (probably UPS) is included as
well.  I have the original box, but only one of the original Styrofoam
end pieces.  I will use a towel on the other end (you get a free towel
too!!).  Worked fine getting it here.  The whole shebang might not fit
in the original box; I will figure this out after the offers come in.
Email any questions and offers.		-Jon.

(original) for around $80 I think this price is way too high.  Then
again, things are worth what someone is will to pay for them....

Since I have some free time while looking for a job I thought 
I would offer Linux on disk and tape for those who need it.


NOTE: I am offering this service for EXPERIENCED users who 
require no support.  Simply put I am just a disk shuffler.  If 
you think you will need support I HIGHLY recommend  
Softlanding Linux System (SLS) directly.  They provide an
excellent product at a decent price with support.

I am the lazy mans service, for those who don't want to spend 
4 hours on the modem and 2 hours shuffling floppies.  And 
those who don't need SLS support and opt to go it alone.

What you get... each disk is $1.50(5.25) 
                             $1.75(3.5)       (14 disk minimum).

A Minimal System     : 4 Disks   6.00/7.00
B Base System Extras : 7 Disks   10.50/12.25
C Compilers          : 3 Disks   4.50/5.25
D Documentation      : 2 Disks   3.00/3.50
S Source, misc.      : 1 Disk    1.50/1.75

I have a copy of this catalog in front of me as I write this.
It does have tons of qool stuff in it. 
My impression is that they try not to send it out to "browsers". It
appears that if your not a buyer or an engineer they do not want to
waste a catalog on you. When you get a catalog there's a "VIP Code" you
have to give them "to ensure your continued subscription.".
Anyway, if you want to get in touch with them, the company is

Personal Computing Tools
550 Division Street
Campbell, CA 95008
(408) 378-8400 
(They also have fax #'s and toll free #'s for ordering and tech support)

Please note that I am not associated with them in any way. In fact, I
have never ordered from them so I can't comment on their products or
service but the catalog is real and I am sitting here salivating over
it.

Well, I've been informed that the price on the whole thing I'm selling is now
less than the price I'm selling it for.  That will teach me to wait that long
before getting rid of electronic equipment.  Nevermind, everyone, I'm keeping
the thing.

	1987 ARIENS RIDING LAWN MOWER

	This mower is in perfect condition and

	- 26 inch cut
	- Double Rear Baggers
	- New Battery
	- New Engine (one year old)
	- Inflatable Tires (gives nice ride)
	- Cushioned Seat (gives nice ride)

	I am moving into a house that has a
	small area of grass to cut and does not
	require such large mower. The engine was
	replaced, not rebuilt, last year due to
	some faulty work done by a lawn mower
	repair shop.

I have a set of four 235-60-R14 Big O tires that I had on my 1988 Thunder 
Bird. We bought them and then traided the car in. They would not give me 
anything for them so I had them taken off. We drove about 2,000 miles on 
them. They are 40,000 mile tires. They are sporty looking low-profile, and 
take corners realy well. If you are interested please contact me at (208)384-

It is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to
use the net to directly advertise their products.

In addition to improper etiquette, this product is a mailing list
used for generating junk mail.  

Am I correct in assuming this is improper, and if so, what can be 
done to penalize such an improper use?

I'd offer $150 for your scanner, shipping at your expense, payment to
be sent by personal check within 24 hours after receipt of goods -- or if
you live nearby and can deliver, payment in cash with 24 hour advance notice
so I can go to the bank.  If sent by mail, I reserve the right to return
it at my expense if when I check it out I find it to be defective in some
way.

BTW, why would you sell such a fine scanner?  Did you replace it with
some other instrument or find it not to be satisfactory in some way?

	As a matter of fact D.J., it does make a difference.
	Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year,
	many of them are commercial businesses. The ban on commercial
	use of Internet is no more.

	One should have the breeding not to post commercial material
	on an account provided by ones employer or school, unless the
	provider of such account gives permission. (HA!)

	Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only
	by our innate good taste and no have no "administrator" to 
	guide(?) us.

I participated a promotion by a company called Visual Images. 
They sent me a award certificate three months ago and asked 
me to buy their promotion package in order to receive the major
award. They mislabled my address and I did not receive my package
until one month ago. I was mad and angry about how it took them
so long to get my package. So I wrote them a letter and requested
for a refund. They never return my letter. I was lucky enough to
find out their telephone number through operator and received the
package. I immediately returned the package and wrote them another
letter to ask for refund. The package was returned because they
address they put on the package was incorrect. I attempted to 
call them and learnd that they have changed their telephone number.
It took me at least 10 phone calls to find out their new number,
but they refused to take any responsibility. I spoke to their
manager and she said she would call me back, but she has not call
yet. But I was able to get their address from their front desk.
Should I just go ahead and send the package? Or should I waite until
they call me back?

I know there are several people on the net has experience with the
same company. I would like to know how they got their money back.
If you have similar experience, please advise me.

Thanks in advance,

        Smith Corona Typewriter for sale,

        Model SCM 70 electric.

Great for forms, envelopes, labels, small things, etc. that you just
can't do with your microcomputer.

Built like a tank, but not big nor that heavy.  A classic compact
electric, with padded storage bag.  No scratches, enamel paint chips
or dents.  Cloth ribbon, 2 colours.  Will accept best offer near $70.

(Selling for a friend, so these are her instructions not mine.
RSVP to this account, though.  Make any other offers anyways,
I'll pass them along.  A single sheet-feeder for the Macintosh
Imagewriter II would be acceptable in trade, for example.)

Dear Fellow Usenet Users:

	I would like to give a formal apology for posting an advertisement 
about my printing business.  I did not intend this to be an advertisement, 
but rather an offer for people on the usenet, many of whom use printing
on a regular basis.  I was not aware that this is not "legal" on the usenet.
I am only trying to put myself through college.  For those of you who
requested information, I will write to you privately.  For those of you who 
are having fun flooding my mailbox, I think you can grow up.  To offer advice
is one thing, but to use profanity toward me is another.

Thank you,

   After hearing about the McGovern House story on Paul Harvey I never had any
idea how much it was worth.  The autograph is on a Senate Pass card
and is signed 'John Kennedy.'  I don't remember if it was signed 
'Senator John Kennedy' or whether or not it was dated, because I haven't
looked at it in quite a while.  Currently it is in a safety deposit box.
I would rather sell to a private collector rather then go through an auction
house such as Christy's since that would tend to take away from the profit. 
If you (or any collector you may know) has an interest in this please send
me an e-mail expressing your interest.  I will see what I can do to make 
a scanned gif of it available to prospective buyers.

Hello Everyone,

    I have a Casio TV-470 LCD Color Television for sale.  It
is in mint condition.  Retail is $199 but I'm looking to
get about 1/2 of that for it, tops.  Highest bidder in 
a week gets it, assuming the highest bidder is at least $60.

TV comes with black case and uses 4 AA batteries.  They also
sell AC adaptor.  It has external jack for phones and external
antenna, etc.  The picture is very good and it has electronic
tuning so you don't have to screw with tuning a picture in, etc.
I have the box and all documentation.  This has seen less than
3 hours use as I have all but sworn off TV.

Best Regards
Jack Waters II

Summary: I am backing out because someone is selling me another
Keywords: Digital Audio Tape Sony TCD-D3 DAT Walkman

Lines: 64

        I recently backed out of purchasing an almost-unused Sony TCD-D3 DAT
Walkman, having found someone else who has a unit I personally prefer (and am
paying more for).  However, it's still a heck of a machine for the price -- it
is quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It's probably the
most popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)

        Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and
here's what he told me:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is what is included:
        - TCD-D3 DATman.
        - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for
          analog output.
        - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).
        - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The
          unit is still under factory warrantee.
        - AC adaptor/battery charger.
        - Rechargable battery.

I paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don't mind if I keep the 60 minute
tape it came with (I have some samples on it!).

[By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he's including an
 extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about
 $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5
 years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        I'm not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice.
Send him mail and ask him what he wants.

        Again, I've used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly
understand why it is as popular as it is.  I've been using one for a little
while, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also point
out that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and
had truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machine
that was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher
Conspiracy for their recent live album.)

        Bryan Davis says:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels
in S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported
problem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        'nuff said.

        The reason I'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a
unit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don't have any
optical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has
some other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn't.  (I am also paying more
for the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are
available if you absolutely must have one.

        Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.  (So do Sony Minidiscs,
by the way.)

        Anyway, if you're interested, get in touch with bdavis@netcom.com.

someone gave me this brand new card.  I am thinking to sell it cuz
I don't need it.  but the problem is that i don't even know what this
is.
this was made by Forte Communications Co. it has 2 board combined
together (looks wierd  to me) and has 2 9 pin ports (one male and one
female), and also has a round port (like BNC, not sure).
this was made in 1986, and has a "fortegraph emulator & diagnostic" disk
with it.

has anyone here ever seen this or known what this is.

appreciate your help in advance.

FOR SALE:

     (including filters & negative carriers)

* Darkroom supplies 
     (containers, trays, thermometer, beakers, 
     paper focuser, etc...I also have paper & 
     chemicals, but I think these 2 are past 
     expiration date)


Everything is in great working condition.  I bought it 
about a year ago and it has served its purpose well.  
It hasn't been used it in a few months because I don't 
have the time or money to keep up with it and its just 
sitting in my bathroom taking up space I'd like to use.
So, I'd like to sell it to someone who would use it 
rather than it collect dust in my bathroom.

If you are interested in the whole package, I will sell 
everything (including shipping) for $300.  If you have 
something else in mind, I'm open to suggestions.

Please reply to this account.

Thank you...
Michelle

I have one of those HEAVY antique upright pianos I would like to

If I get no response from a charity I will sell to for $100, you haul.

It is in good shape, needs tuning.  I'm in south Durham county.

AMD recent won the appeal against Intel to use their Microcode, so they 
should be putting out real 486 chips in the near future.

"Bare" = case, a power supply, and a motherboard (with RAM and a coprocessor).
Everything else is yours to add as you like.

The motherboard:
    - US-made Micronics 8-slot motherboard with Intel 386dx/25mhz CPU
    - 64kb SRAM cache
    - 4mb 80us RAM using 4x1mb simms (worth $120 alone)
    - Cyrix 83D87 math coprocessor (worth $90 alone)
    - Norton SI 6.0 rating of 26.1
    - Latest version Phoenix BIOS

The case/power supply:
     - Standard desktop case. 230watt power supply with the usual connectors.
     - Room for five floppy/hard drives (three visible, two internal).

*New* Micronics CPUs often command a several-hundred dollar premium
over clone motherboards because they are US-made, use high-quality
components, and are known to be both very reliable and compatible. They
have been OEMed in systems sold by both Gateway and Zeos at various
points in the past. (Check out the ads in the back pages of Byte or PC
Magazine if you want to see this price differential for yourself.)

Price: $450 complete, $100 less if you don't want/need the case and

   Dragon's Lair II ($400 Complete)
-------------------------------------
 
 
  or 
 
   $220 Laser Disc
   $150 Motherboard/Joystick/buttons
   $35  Graphics (For arcade cabinet)
   $50  Brick Power Supply +12/-12/+5
 
  Space Ace ($430 Complete)

   $50  Brick Power Supply +12/-12/+5
    
 
   Both Space Ace and Dragon's Lair II ($750)
-----------------------------------------------
 
   These games require a Sony 1450 Laserdisc player.  The
nice thing about this player is that you can also watch
normal Laserdisc movies on it as well.  I have one which I
will sell for $600 by itself, $550 with a purchase of one
complete system or $500 if you buy both systems.
 
    I currently run this into my entertainment center.  I have
it housed in a PC computer case with with its own fan, and 
power supply.  I run the audio into my stereo system, and the
laserdisc runs directly into the T.V..  I have made a mount for
the joysticks and the buttons.  First person who buys both
games will get it all, otherwise you have to do it yourself.
 
    If you would prefer to have it all housed in a normal
arcade cabinet this can be done as well.  The graphics will
go nicely along the sides and front of the cabinet.
 
    Everything works perfectly.  The laserdisc player has an
RS-232 port which you can use to develop your own multimedia
type applications.  The Laserdiscs have been stored in a safe
place and have no scratches on them.
 
    If you are interested please email me.
 
    Thanks,
 
     Soren

The only option you "should" jumper is the drive select, shown as "4C32C1"
above.  There is also a drive power-up option jumper (elsewhere on the
drive's board) but the odds of that having been unset are slim.

Since the 3B1 "normally" has only one HD, you would jumper betwwwn "C1" to
select the first (possible) drive address; if the 2190 is your second drive
on the 3B1, then jumper between "2C".

Items for sale.....

This package was bought throught a award give-away company. I attempted
to cancel my order before I received the package, but I was too late and
the company refused to take the package back for refund. I know the truth
which I would never get my $697 back, but I wish to get my money back as
close as possible. Here is the describtion of the package...

Nishika 3D camera	It takes very good picture, never been opended
			or used. It came with wide angle flesh, carring
			case, film, and a instruction video. It has four
			lens and created a 3D effect on a regular 35mm
			film.

Jewelry			It came with the package as additional gift.

Bahama vacation voucher	The voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport.
			The users get a special hotel rate of $27 per-person
			per-night. Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is
			_not_ included.

Las Vegas, Reno, Orlando	The voucher provides one RT airfare, and
				hotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights.
				Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is not
				included. The voucher is good for all 3
				locations, but you can't travel to all 3
				places at once.

Cancun, Mexico		The voucher provides one RT airfare, and hotel
			accomodation for 3 days / 2 nights. Meals and
			ground transfer, hotel tax is not included as
			usual.

I paid $697 for the whole package. So try not to be cold-blooded when you
make your offer. Details would be provided by request. I do wish to sell
the whole package at once. So if you are just looking for the vacation
vouchers, I don't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric
If you are interested in the camera, you could treat the vacation vouchers
as gift.

If you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected
to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards. 
Trust me, you would get the exactly the same package as I did. There is 
only one award which will be given away. So don't bother even to call them 
back, if you are really interested, you could get it from me for a cheaper 
price. And you could receive the package within a week ( I waited three 
months to get my first and final packages). Also, they would ask for your
credit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit 
card company. So why spend more than you should when you could get them
from me for a cheaper price.

If you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I really
wish to get this over with. Make me an offer, if I am confortable with
your offer, I would send the package by U.P.S. the next day morning.
More details could be given if you wish.

I am selling my FIAT 850 Spyder:

	This sleek little convertable has served me well through my past
year in San Diego, but I am going away for the summer and I have nowhere
to keep it, so on the aution block it goes.

	1971 Fiat 850 Sport
	White body
	White Hard Top (refurbished)
	Ivory Convertable Top (refurbished)
	New Black interior
	
	Come with high performance exhaust system
	Larger rebuilt engine (910 instead of 805)
	Car mats
	Smog checked, registered until 1994

This is the ultimate in San Diego driving. I will not guarantee that
this car will attract people to you of the opposite gender, but they
will ask for a ride. One warning, this is a high performance Italian
SPORTS car, if you want a boring little set of wheels this is NOT the
car for you, this car requires care. It has a manual choke, a 4-speed
manual transmision, manual throttle control, and even manual wiper
pump. If you KNOW how to drive then and only then can you appreciate
this car.

Feel free to inquire. The price is $1750 and all inspection has to be in
the San Diego area since school keeps me here all the time.

This drive is less than one year old.  The cartridges have all been bought
since then.  All is in excellent condition and still under warranty.
Due to a change in system use, I now need a large, contiguous drive.

Offer includes:
	SyDos 44i internal drive
	SCSI adapter card and cables
	All original documentation
	Software
	All original packaging
	8 cartridges totalling over 350Mb (no bad sectors or defects)

The installation was a breeze on my 386 clone.

I will trade for something near 300Mb IDE, or sell for $450.
I will also consider trading for 4 4Mx9 30 pin SIMMs at 70ns.

I have the following item for sale:

Electronic Typewriter: Panasonic KT-32, with 22K memory, small LCD display. I'm
	selling it bundled with a Panasonic computer interface (RPK105) for this
	typewriter. You can connect it to any PC parallel port (sorry, no
	cable). It works perfect, even in Windows (TTY printer). It's
	great if you need to send letter with "typewriter look". In
	stand-alone mode it has 3 pitches, and several "effects" like
	underline, bold, overstrike. Built-in dictionary and character/word/
	line correction. Asking $150 for both the typewriter and the
	interface

There are many people want to buy my Kodak autofocus carousel projectors
but I don't have lenses or remote to sell.  They prefer to buy a projector
with all accessaries.  So I have to post another news asking for lenses
to fit those Kodak slide projectors:

I am willing to give away Singer Caramate II or Singer Caramete SP (
w/ built-in unremovable lens, built-in casette player, speaker, new 500 HR
bulb) try to trade for Kodak projector lenses.

Each projector (viewer) will equal trade for 1 or 2 Kodak projector lenses
depend on the focal length.  I will pay for the shipping for Singer 
projector (viewer).

Since I don't need those Singer projectors, if you have some 35mm SLR system
you don't need, I am willing to do the trade as well.

I have a Tektronix T921 15Mhz scope for sale.  It is a nice, simple
unit to learn on.  I used it while I was in school.  If you want one
to play with at home, this is easy and inexpensive.  It has a nice
handle and is quite lightweight and easy to move around.

I will consider selling the probes seperately for $25 ea.  They are HP
10017A probes suitable for this type of scope.  The probes are NOT
included in the price of $99 for the scope.

If you need more technical info, you will have to come look at it, as
I am not a scope expert and what I have said is all I know.

Indeed! Word is, Intel's lawsuit against AMD was absolutely THROWN OUT of

   I have a 24-pin printer which is an ALPs Allegro24.  It's both a fast
printer with LQ and a very sophisticated design.  It has a straight paper
path and the capability of auto-forwarding sheets to tear off and then back
(a big paper saver as you never have to waste sheets to get a current
print out).  It can also handle single sheets without removing the formfeed
and has sophisticated preferences options (you can interactively program
all the preferences to control the printer and get printed feedback without
ever using a computer).  You get prompts and menus to pick your current setup
and default set up.  This was THE top of the line LQ dot matrix when I bought
it three years ago for $399.  It is also Epson LQ2500 compatible (besides it's
own modes) and comes with IBM driver software (which I've never used since I
own an Amiga).  Has a card slot for upgrading memory or fonts.

    I'll let it go for $150 including shipping prepaid.  COD orders must pay
all shipping and COD costs.

   Also a light gun and UFORCE controller for Nintendo but with PD driver

Best offer over $75 ($30 less than my cost and they are both brand new).

	However, Thad, you should note that he said that he would like to
use it on a 'PC', not 'UNIX-PC'.  Also note the strange cross-posting (as he
probably did not), so it is not sure exactly what sort of machine he intends
to mount it on.  If it *is* a PC (or clone), then the "2C" jumper would be
the correct choice.

	I've left the cross-posting in effect, since I'm not sure which
newsgroup he would really be reading this in. :-)

 If you think the prices I listed above is unrealistic, please mail

 The reason I am selling this stuff is because I have decided that
 I had enough with this hobby of PC computing and I want to move on
 other interests.

 One last thing, if you know any non-profit organization whom might
 be interested in my equipments, please let me know. Because if no
 one wants to buy them, I might as well donate them and get a tax
 break...

 Thanks.

  Sorry for any confusion I may have created.  The disk did come out of
a VS2000 and I would like to use it in a IBM PC clone.  The reason that I
posted to comp.sys.3b1 was because I saw the drive (XT2190) mentioned
in a for-slae notice.  I had asked for info before but didn't receive
any replies.

  Thanks once again for the help.

Colin.

   I have a few the original IBM 10Mb harddisks for sale. They are actually
Seagate's ST412, MFM, full height,  has the IBM logo and black face plate. 
 
  Each disk is checked and formatted with DOS 5.0. It can be doubled to 
20Mb or so with dblspace or stacker if you so desire.  Have the original IBM
foam fitted boxies and anti-static bags. I am not sure if they were ever 
used, but each drive that is sent out will be quarenteed in good working order. 
 
 $30 each plus shipping cost, (about $5), 
 
  If you have one of those old IBM XT or PCs, this is for you !  It's cheaper
than a floppy drive !

Almost sold, but the potential buyer has an opportunity to buy a DSO from a
co-worker...so the following is still available:

Used, good condition:
Hitachi V-422 40MHz Dual-Channel Portable Analog Oscilliscope
	o 1mV/div
	o DC offset
	o alternate magnification (10x magnified & non-magnified waveform)
	o VERT mode trigger
	o TV sync separation circuit

List price	$910.00 (...and the price Fry's electronics just quoted!) :-(
Sells for	$699.99 (JDR MicroDevices current price)
		$745.95 (Products International)
Your price used $425.00 obo
But wait - now  $350.00 obo

Buy it, take it home, pretend you can fix simple household appliances...or just
watch the alternating current running through your house!

I'm open to trades of radio, video or computer equipment...but I don't want to
trade for another scope! :-)

I'd prefer a local buyer, because (a) a local buyer can check it out and (b) a
local buyer can take it with him/her.

ALL,

Finally cleaned out the storage room and have the following items
for sale:

             C-64 Computer
             2-1542 Disk Drives
             1351 Mouse
             all cables
             lots of software (mostly games)

The computer and drives work (hooked it to the TV to test)
except for sound-evidently the sound chip is gone. When GEOS
was loaded, the mouse would not respond, so assume it is bad.
Could be used for the games, or for spare parts.

If interested, would accept any reasonable offers.

Send replies to ihlpl!rsbrd or call (708) 979-8816.

I have numerous 7000 series scopes which are surplus to requirements.
These devices range from fully functional to having a fault which
remained unrepaired since they weren't needed any longer.

My query is: is there anybody in Australia interested in buying them?

I think the shipping costs would make it impractical to send them O/S.
(Certainly the mainframes, but if you're willing to pay shipping, I'll
consider offers for individual plug-ins).

For those who are in the know (anywhere in the world), what are these 
bits worth second hand in your area?

I have:
	11	7603 Mainframes
	4	7A15 Vertical Amp
	18	7A15A Vertical Amp
	1	7A16 Vertical Amp
	10	7A22 Differential Amp (10uV / Div, 1 MHz, 100,000:1 CMRR)
	6	7B50 Timebase
	8	7B50A Timebase
	1	7B51 Timebase

in addition, I have the following, which have been smoke damaged in a fire
and, although washed, are probably a little more prone to failure than
the others:

	2	7603 Mainframes
	5	7403N Mainframes
	5	7A15 Vertical Amp
	2	7A15A Vertical Amp
	5	7B50 Timebase

Overall, I suspect that the 7A22's are worth as much as all the rest
put together. All bar one of these are operational - that one failed
and has never been repaired because it was no longer needed.

The 7A22 has an on-board voltage offset as well as switchable high-
and low- pass filters. There is _nothing_ on the market, to my
knowledge, that comes close to the specs of this plug-in.

All of the above have service manuals.

BUY MY DATADESK MAC-101E!!!!!!
 
I've gotten some Repetitive Syndrome Injury, and thus I bought an Apple
Split keyboard.
 
I don't need two keyboards, so I'm selling it....(the datadesk that is)
 
$85 or best offer - includes ground shipping... may or may not include the
ADB cable. Probably will.

Hello fellow humans, and other net creatures...
 
If you're at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me:
djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu
 
I'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so I have
two monitors and cards for sale. Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces,
I'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from one
screen.
 
I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (within
driving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if you
don't live near here. Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxes
for the monitors, but I'm confident that my few months of full-time service
in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and
flip it in your direction.
 
Details:
 
Mirror Full Page Display (monochrome) w/nubus card:
---------------------------------------------------
**SOLD**
 
Sony 1304 14" color monitor:
----------------------------
What's to say? It got top ratings in last year's MacUser report. It's a SONY,
Trinitron, arguably the best (but I'd rather not argue that point).
It's a great monitor, in great shape, but I'm going to a bigger screen,
and although I'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it.
 
Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - not
including shipping), will sell for **$400** [was $475 orig. asking price]
(plus shipping). Again, make an offer if that sounds unreasonable.
 
 
RasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM):
------------------------------------------------------------------
Renamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13"
monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode
(you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and output
NTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or a
RAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 meg
SIMMS).
 
Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking
**$425** [was $525 orig. asking price](shipping included this time,
it's just a card). Original box and packaging. I'd actually prefer to sell
the Sony monitor and this card together, so if you want both, drop me e-mail
and make a "bundled offer" for these items.
 
If you check the May 93 (or was it Feb 93) Macworld mag, you'll find that the
24sx (or 24si - same thing) board did extremely well in the tests for 13-14"
640 x 480 24-bit boards. Also supports up to 1120 (or so) x 512 in 24-bit, so
you can fit two pages width-wise via the scrolling desktop thang. It's a great
board, but I'm going to a 19" monitor, and it can't help me there.

------------
 
Cheers.

Hi to all.

Since all of you could also be a seller as well as a buyer, I'd like to bring
this issue for discussion - what would be the best solution in case a deal 
became a lemon?

As I understand most people selling things over the net do not grant a warranty,I am in such a situation that the seller did not state whether a warranty would be granted or not and the item I received is out of order. The seller insisted
that it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that I paid if I send the item back to him and after he is sured it
is bad. Is this reasonable?

Basically I would like to believe the seller tells the truth. Also, I am positively to say that I've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of 
the thing. My assumption here is everyone is honest - so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars.

I would like to hear your opinion - either in here or directly respond to my
e-mail address.

I know there is such a risk that you could lose money. But, how can we make it
enjoyable to most people and not wasting the bandwidth?

I'm sure that the Motorola is worth it, but this kind of thing
has always mystified me.  $400 is the price of very good, new
dual-band, fully synthasized HT.  Yes, yes, I know Motorola
HTs are bullet-proof, unbreakable, plutonium-based 
indestructable -- you can drive a tank over them and they'll
still work.  But just how often does that come up?  Why are hams
willing (and they *are*) to spend the price of a synthaszied
dual-bander for a 2-channel xtal rig???  Note: this is not
a flame; as I said, I'm sure this is a good deal for this rig.
I'm just amazed that it *is* a good deal.  I would have guessed
that a 2 channel xtal rig could never be worth as much as a dual-
bander to a ham, no matter how durable. Just shows you how wrong
*I* can be.

Mike, N4PDY

	Well, Dale, I'd say offhand "Keel-hauling" would work pretty
well...we haven't had a good "keel-hauling" in a long time... (Sorry, it came up in a conversation yesterday and, well, I just love that phrase...)
	Or maybe just ask for folks to flood the guys mailbox with
the FAQ for net-etiquitte...sort of poetic justice for all the junk mail
he was trying to generate anyway...

I was my understanding that the purpose of those removeable-front-panels
were to make the radio useless, and thus discourage theft (that is if the 
cover were removed by the owner and taken along whenever the car was left.)

If those covers were sold for anything remarkably less than the radio 
originally costs, or even sold at all,
then the above discouragement wouldn't be so great.

I personally would be unhappy, if I bought a radio like that, thinking that 
removing the cover greatly depreciated the radio's value, and the covers were
sold by the company (or other legitimate source) cheaply.

Time to clear out some miscellaneous lenses, cameras and photo stuff
that's not being used.  Some are gems, some are mundane.
 
 
Minolta AF 50/1.7 lens for Maxxum cameras.  New lens, but I guess it'd
be best to call it a "demo" since I did not get the literature, box or
warranty cards.  $30.
 
Vivitar 2X converter for Nikon F or AI lenses.  Pretty cute "flip back"
tang so it will work with all manual focus Nikon lenses - and bodies.
It will even couple (and double) a non-AI lens to an AI body.  $15.
 
Pentax 50/1.4 screwmount lens.  Well actually it's a Super-Takumar which
is what they all were back then.  Very mint condition.  $25. Nice hard
case for this lens $5 more..
 
Alpex 135/2.8 lens.  Beautifully made, all metal construction with fine
optics.  Minolta mount.  $25.  Another hard case that fits this with
strap can be added..call it $7 more.
 
Vivitar 283 flash.  The one that made Vivitar famous (until the 285
eclipsed it).  Tilt head, removable sensor, variable auto exposure.
$30.
 
Universal "Roamer 63" folding old "bellows" camera with leather case.
Uses 120 or 620 film, 100mm F6.3 lens.  Kinda cool articulated shutter
release.  Decent shape.  $20.
 
Weston 540 lightmeter.  Nothin super fancy, but it works well, and is a
good cross check to built in meters.  $7 with case and strap.
 
And finally..the "gems"
 
Pentax Auto 110 camera with 24mm F2.8 lens.  This is the little
(and I do mean TINY) SLR that Pentax made.  Has interchangeable lenses,
but try and find the 20-40 zoom, true through the lens viewing with
split image focus, and completely auto exposure.  $70.
 
Olympus 35RC rangefinder camera.  A really cute little camera with 42mm
lens (F2.8) with built in manual or auto exposure, self timer etc.  I
think this was the predecessor to the XA - and it's nearly all metal.
I won't mind holding onto this one if it doesn't sell.  $60.
 
Olympus OM-1 with flash shoe, leatherette case, 50/1.4 Zuiko lens, and
Tokina SD (Super Dispersion) 70-210 lens.  These are all in very nice to
mint condition, except for one little ding on the OM body near the film
advance lever.  Lenses are perfect, and the Tokina is a very compact,
and sharp lens.  $225 for the set.
 
 
That'll do to clean out some of the stuff.  Feel free to offer on this
stuff, although the cheaper stuff is priced to cover my hassle in
shipping it..
 
For more details call or email.

Fellow netters,

I have an Okidata printer I would like to sell.  A description follows:

Okidata 180 printer including cables for both IBM compatibles (Centronics
parallel) and Commodore (RS-232 - round).  Also includes power cable, manual,
and a handful of computer paper to get you started.  This is a 9-pin printer. 
I recently cleaned the printhead and installed a new ribbon.  A print sample 
can be provided upon request.  This is a very dependable printer - it never
jams or does "weird" things.  I have used it with a Commodore for about 3 years
and am now using it with my 486sx.  I use mainly WordPerfect 5.1 (see next
post) for which I got a driver (at no charge) that directly supports the 
Okidata 180 in Epson FX mode. 

When I got the printer, it was selling for around $200-220 new (I got mine
from Tenex brand new - for a Christmas present).  I would like to get about
$100 or so for it.  If you are interested at all in it, please give me a ring
(E-Mail) and make an offer.

Fellow netters,

I just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out
there (even outside of Iowa).  I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting
space, but I thought you might want some relief from the "So-and-so is a thief"
posts.  Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be
nice to hear some good news once in a while.

After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a
request for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50
in his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded
more than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day. 
Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a
message from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed
the money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and
assured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He
sent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a
transfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him
to fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times
to get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for
my signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the
deal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world's
best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good
ones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat
you may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my
software from him.

Bravo, Mr. Miller!

- Kevin Harter

The front covers should be available from Sony.  Check with a local car
stereo shop.  You will probably (definitely) have to provide the units 
serial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card.  I 
don't know the cost, but replacements have to be available to people
who damage the face cover, so it stands to reason that it can be replaced.

As to deterring theft:

When I worked for a stereo shop, we referred the customer to a Sony 800
number.  We would not sell the face, nor did we have them available.  Most
people who came in asking for the face cover (or a pullout sleave for that
matter) would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deck
they couldn't use.  If theft occurs with these decks, notify Sony.  Serial
numbers do catch theives.

Just a thought,
Michael

Hi,
I am one those uncles that try to please my nephews whenever possible,
so.. they have asked me to find them some Nitendo games, no, it is
not for the super nitendo.. it is for whatever model came prior to
that.

Since they are overseas, I will first ask them if they already have the
games you would have to offer me. Please send me a list, or whatever and
the price you are asking so I can send to my nephews and find out what
they have and what they want.. so bare with me, I will respond, but it
will take me a while. 

Thanks,
Walter

I agree. I own one. Aside from the shutter, it is built like
a little tank. A very good camera. Your price sounds reasonable,
too. New, I paid $565 for my KIEV 88 Camera Kit. Good luck.

My little Nash has sat for about a year (had been running), but now I must move
a long distance and there are too many things to carry with me.  Here are the
details of the car:

1958 Hardtop--Exterior condition:
     Rocker panels rusted out at weld points, no rust at typical spots like
     door hinge mounting points, back battery box, etc.  Missing front bumper,
     front pan dented up, one weld popped in front.  This is for the most part
     a solid, restorable automobile.

     Interior Condition:
     Missing original steering wheel, has one of the smaller aftermarket
     wheels, seats need reupholstered, general fair condition.

     Mechanical Condition:
     Had been running, but now does not want to start...needs new rings (which
     I have) also have extra parts such as complete long block, extra steering
     shaft, etc.

For a car that has not been touched since 1958, it is in solid shape.  It will
obviously need some work, but will make a good project.

PRICE:  Well, this is a tough one, I would like to get around 800.00, but will
consider any serious offers by individuals willing to come and get it. If you 
have things to trade such as tools, toys, cameras, comics, cards, etc., 
anything easily movable to Florida, I may consider that as well.

   Is there anyone out there with a copy of the driver for Turtle
Beach's Samplevision program that allows you to use a Always Tech
IN-2000 SCSI card to do SMDI dumps between your PC and your
Peavey DPM-SP / SX / SX2 ???  

   This is normally only available directly from Turtle Beach but I
was just wondering if there was someone who got it and couldn't
find a use for it..

   If you have a copy let me know!

Sounds a little odd but I sold an Amiga hand scanner to
an elementary school teacher in south Florida (Miami, I
think) but I have just recently found that I still have
the scanner manual.  The original shipment included the
software manual, disks, packaging, etc.

Basically, I have since lost the name & address of the 
person I  sold it to...and I would like to get it to him.

If that person sees this, please send me an email to:

dlneal@cbda9.apgea.army.mil

thanx, and sorry for taking up net space.

* 92,000 miles, all highway (I used to commute 160 miles/day)
* 5 speed
* Air Conditioning
* AM/FM/Cassette stereo
* split fold-down rear seat
* 2.2 liter, 12 valve, fuel injected engine 
* roomy interior, comfy back seats, big trunk
* well maintained - oil and filter every 3,000 - 4,000, other maintanence
	as scheduled.  Except for the timing belt which still looks new.
	I did slip and went 5,000 miles without changing the oil once.
* tires have 20,000 miles, lots of life left (probably 30,000 to 40,000)
* front brake job at 84,000, back brakes are still good
* engine/trans/drive train in perfect condition - everything works,
	nothing needs replacing, next tune up scheduled at 120,000
* body is good - left tail light is cracked (I'm trying to find a used
	one - dealer wants $172!), two long scratches and a ding on the
	hood (vandalism?), a bunch of stone chips on the front of the
	hood.  Official Mazda touch up paint included in the deal.

This car is extremely reliable, even better than the Toyota Corolla it
replaced.  Besides the tires, brakes and maintanence items, the only other
parts that have been replaced are the headlight bulbs.

Selling because my wife refuses to drive a car without an automatic trans.
And she wants a station wagon with a sun roof, etc, etc.

I have recently purchased a PB170 and have no more use for my
RasterOps 8XL.  It has been a great card.  I should have traded it
with my IIci, but I forgot.  My forgetfulness si your gain.
Great 8 bit video that supports:

640x480 (Apple 13"/14")
640x870 (Apple Portrait)
800x600 (Silly DOS monitor resolution)
1024x768 (60hz & 75hz)
1152x870 (Apple 21")

Has hardware Pan & Zoom and supports virtual desktops up to the size of
2 Newspaper pages.  Includes standard Apple monitor cable or card to BNC,
you choose.

I am asking $250 (it's still advertised in MacWorld for up to $499). 
Completely negotiable.  I can get a monitor and sell the pair.  I will
accept offers for software or PowerBook accessory trades.
Make an offer.

Greetings netters,
	I have a Seagate 3144 130MB IDE drive forsale.  I bought it yesterday
and have been able to come across a 215MB that I am going to buy, but I 
need to sell this one.  I guarantee that it will work.  There is still a
transferable warranty I believe.  It was only used as a boot drive, not a
server (source) drive.  I just want my money back out of it...$180.  Thanks
a lot and offers appreciated.  Dave 317-495-5978  kari@sage.cc.purdue.edu

reminding us that advertising is not done on Internet:

	   As a matter of fact D.J., it does make a difference.
	   Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year,
	   many of them are commercial businesses. The ban on commercial
	   use of Internet is no more.

Jack, there is a difference between using the network for commercial
purposes and advertising in newsgroups.  Business communication is
okay.  Advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet
who have no desire to receive advertising is not okay.

	   Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only
	   by our innate good taste and no have no "administrator" to 
	   guide(?) us.

I suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material not
in anybody's good taste would find itself getting a lot of attention
it didn't want.  You may belong to the public library, but that
doesn't mean you can deface the books, disorder the stacks, or disturb
the other patrons.

You're constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users (many
academic and military, who get irritable about a network for which
they pay with tax and grant money carrying private business
advertising) follow.  There are Secret Masters here, just like
everywhere else.  They're not as obvious as the ones on Prodigy, but
they're here.

No doubt at some point the Internet, like everything else, will become
grotty enough to carry advertising.  At that time I hope it is
confined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groups---like
misc.writing.

OK.  Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:

02106@chopin.udel.edu or
02106@ravel.udel.edu or
02106@bach.udel.edu or
02106@brahms.udel.edu

NO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!!
LOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!!

Shipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).

For all those who have bought comics from me, thanks!!!

I have a pair of Oakleys that cost about $100 new a year ago.  I hardly ever
wore them because they just don't look right on me.  They are orange and
blue and are the "blade" kind (Terminator style).  I am willing to sell these
for $40 to the first response I get. 
I also have a Bulls vs. Blazers game for the SNES that is in perfect
condition.  I am selling it for $35.  It includes the instruction manual.

That's one.  Any others?

Then they should have used a different advert.

I'm both.  I've made some $4k worth of PC products purchasing
decisions for one company I'm affiliated with in the past 6 months
alone.  (In a delicious bit of irony, an interesting fraction went to
suppliers that I suspect got my mailing address from these people.)
More is in the pipeline right now.

If they wanted to discuss these sorts of things, upfront is the
way to do it.

>When you get a catalog there's a "VIP Code" you

And who issues that "VIP Code"?  (That policy implementation in the
running for this week's "silly twit" award.)  BTW - It turns out that
I have several VIP codes.  Here's the one I'm using for these sorts of
things: "6".  (If you want one, send me mail and I'll put you in touch
with the folks who do the application interview; if you qualify....)

Oh no!  Someone is provided useful information AND mentioned that they
made money in the field.  Don't they know that usenet is reserved for
uninformed speculation by people trying to sell their personal stuff
(from houses to dead pcs) at a huge markup/trying to unload stuff they
bought from their company at just under retail, and other
"non-commercial" activities.

The net is not "supposed" to be a dumping ground for free ads, but
reserving it for tripe doesn't seem to be a significant improvement.

>In addition to improper etiquette, this product is a mailing list
>used for generating junk mail.  

So?  Either they target it well enough to pay for it, in other words,
they manage to send it to people who want the stuff (in which case it
is junk only for the "rest" and the transaction costs are borne
appropriately in this case) or they go bankrupt.  Seems fair to me.

>Am I correct in assuming this is improper, and if so, what can be 
>done to penalize such an improper use?

You could hold your breath.  You could kill offending messages as
they come onto your machine and refuse to send them any further,
but not until you turn blue.

Hmmm... Interesting. What do you mean by WALKING distance? I lived in
Moscow for 21 years, and if I am 5 minutes walk to Belorusskaya
subway station, I CANNOT be walking distance to Kremlin. Unless
1 hour of walking is what you mean. By the way, what is
the price? I may plan a trip there (not sure yet, though) in
late summer.
