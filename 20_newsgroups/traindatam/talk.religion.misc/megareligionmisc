First of all as far as I know, only male homosexuality is explicitly
mentioned in the bibles, so you're off the hook there, I think. In
any event, there are *plenty* of people in many denominations who
do not consider a person's sexual identification of gay/lesbian/bisexual
as an "immoral lifestyle choice"

This is another misconception. You are not being told the whole story.

My former minister is a lesbian, and I know personally and
professionally several openly gay and lesbian ministers. I am
a Unitarian-Universalist and like most others in my denomination,
am pro-choice. You needn't go looking to the Unitarian Universalists
(which is a liberal religion) for acceptance of your sexual
identification and pro-choice views, however; there are many of us
who believe in spirituality AND freedom of conscience.

Good Luck on your journey!

Psalm85(JPS): For the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm. O LORD, You
will favor Your land, restore Jacob's fortune; You will forgive Your
people's iniquity, pardon all their sins; Selah; You will withdraw all Your
anger, turn away from Your rage. Turn again, O God, our helper, revoke
Your displeasure with us. Will you be angry with us forever, prolong
Your wrath for all generations? Surely You will revive us again, so that
Your people may rejoice in You. Show us, O LORD, Your faithfulness;
grant us Your deliverance. Let me hear what God, the LORD, will speak;
He will promise well-being to His people, His faithful ones; may they
not turn to folly. His help is very near those who fear Him, to make His
glory dwell in our land. Faithfulness and truth meet; justice and
well-being kiss. Truth springs up from the earth; justice looks down
from heaven. The LORD also bestows His bounty; our land yields its
produce. Justice goes before Him as He sets out on His way.

   Not to be too snide about it, but I think this Christianity must
   be a very convenient religion, very maliable and suitable for
   any occassion since it seems one can take it any way one wants
   to go with it and follow whichever bits one pleases and
   reinterpret the bits that don't match with one's desires.  It
   is, in fact, so convenient that, were I capable of believing
   in a god, I might consider going for some brand of Christianity.
   The only difficulty left then, of course, is picking which sect
   to join.  There are just so many.
    
   Dean Kaflowitz

Yes, Christianity is convenient.  Following the teachings of Jesus
Christ and the Ten Commandments is convenient.  Trying to love in a
hateful world is convenient.  Turning the other cheek is convenient.  So
convenient that it is burdensome at times.

Too many clues, not enough substance.  You ask a lot of

It does not... or it can not?  When you freze water, you've created an

And, you find the idea of a god more likely?

Besides, we can apply the anthropic principle to circumvent any

This is exactly the type of thing I was talking about before. A creationist
appears on t.o, makes a completely unsupported statement the facts of
which he/she is completely ignorant, is taken to task, and finally replies
with a subtle insult. (actually two insults)

Just to make sure I am being fair let's check a few details. Jack, you don't
know anything about abiogenesis, do you? (this is no sin, I know next to
nothing about it either) I mean, anything other than this "10^50" 
probability thing which you got wrong in the first post.

The speculation involved is really your own, isn't it? How much _biology_
do you know, even apart from abiogenesis? Any classes past high school?
Read Chris Colby's FAQ? How much paleontology, geology, etc do you know?
Or are you speculating that its all speculative? Do you have any basis
upon which to imply that to keep an "open mind" one must allow that
the earth, universe, and all the creatures in it could have been created
~10,000 years ago? None of this is intended as a flame. To say that
you don't know a subject is _not_ the same as calling you an idiot. I
don't know _much_ about these areas, but then I am not the one
calling into question all of mainstream science. In other words, where
do you get off calling it speculative unless by this you also mean that
all of physics, chemistry, etc are also speculative in some sense?

You may have, in fact, not been implying that the rejection of creationism
is a sign of close-mindedness, or that the theory of evolution is especially
speculative, in which case I have merely misinterpreted
you. In this case the worst thing you could be accused of is unclear
prose.

I'm curious to know what purpose people think these lists serve.
Lists like this seem to value quantity over quality, an "argument
from article length."  And the list you have here is of poorer
quality than most.  Since the quotes seem to be taken from an
on-line bible, I doubt that there will be much problem with
verses quoted inaccurately.  But that isn't the problem here.

I've known a lot of fundamentalists in my life, but none who
denied that there were errors in transmission, etc.  And many of
the contradictions here -- Solomon having 40,000 horse stalls in
one verse, and 4,000 in another -- are just the sort of
contradiction that fundies don't have a problem with, in my
experience.  So how do these sorts of contradictions amount to
anything more than attacking a straw man?

Some of the others are just silly, or rely on taking quotes out
of context, or have reasonable explanations.  But even the ones
that are genuine contradictions need to have more said about
them than what is given here.  (At the very least, some effort
should be made to understand and respond to the common replies
given by fundies.)  Look for example at the research that Dave
Butler put into an article examining a false prophecy about Tyre.
That would be an excellent start for an anti-inerrancy list that
would have some teeth.  (One well-researched and documented
contradiction is worth more than one hundred quotes taken out
of context and thrown together in a list.)

Lists like this that just toss a bunch of quotes together to
make a bible verse salad just don't cut it.  Those of us who
want to argue against inerrancy should find this sort of thing
as embarassing as the fundies should find Josh McDowell.

dj

P.S. You can find some good material at ftp.rutgers.edu in
/pub/soc.religion.christian/others/contradictions.  The quality
is very uneven on both sides of the argument (it is just a
compilation of things many people have written), but some of
it would be useful in an anti-inerrancy FAQ.  After exams, I
might be willing to help put it together.

Shoot out in Salt Lake!  PLEDGE versus Committee for a Libertarian
Majority.  Will the party's membership and platform definitions change? 
Is compromise possible?  The Platform and Bylaws committees are
responsible for making recommendations to the convention concerning
changes in those documents.  At this convention, the party will only
consider deletions to the platform.  The Convention Rules would have to
be amended by a 2/3 vote to change this rule.

The meetings are open to the public.  There is no charge for attending.

He sounds really cute, Morte!  Kinds like _pete's dragon_, maybe smaller,
maybe a different species.. winge'd?  (shakespear wing-ED)

I've always hat a horde of mice to turn to for fun & sort of that kind of
mouse in Cinderella (walt disney).  I grew up sort of as an only child,
part time.. my siblings were 10-8-6 years older than me, so i was pretty
commonly a different sort of charater in their games (read: non speaking
hot cocoa-goffer, stand in (still silent) bad guy/good guy/etc), so my
mice were playmates, more than advisors.

Could curt, or whomever has a good list of books please post such list,
in all sorts of fields, like jungian, condensed buddist/etc philosophies,
multiple personailty disorders, or good fiction that has well worked
imaginary friends?

thanks,

While mark claims that his honor would demand that he apologize, it seems
that he would apologieze *if* he were wrong, which takes seeing that he
would be wrong in some situation or other.

Woolfie (lupus would be a cool name for a child) points out that his
brother would see himself as honorable, and not see his mother's point of 
view.

My sister has played go between, twixt me and my mother, since I can't
seem to find words that my mother understands on some issues of boundaries,
and such personal things.  Not that we dont talk, or anything quite so
drastic, but that it can be hard to reconsile two points of view..

thanks, wolfie, i see some of your point.. and mark, i may see yours,
but it doesnt quite follow the same path, to me, as wolfe's..

I believe you will find me the exception to the rule.  I don't claim

By the way, what was giberish?  Was it the four letter alphabet?``

True, except that I've known few fundies who had enough sense to

Someone posted a list of x number of alleged Bible contradictions.  As Joslin
said, most people do value quantity over quality.  Dave Butler posted some good
quality alleged contradictions that are taking a long time to properly exegete.

If you want a good list (quantity) - _When Critics Ask, A Popular Handbook On
Bible Difficulties_ by Dr. Norman Geisler deals with over 800 alleged contradictions.

Hello.


I just read my first newspaper in a while and noticed an article on a
'messianic cult' leader named 'David Koresh'.

I'd like to know more about this and what is going on with them.

Please email me as I don't normally read this newsgroup.  Thanks.

Oh, yeah?  Well---*I* know of ....

Anyways, cannibalism is much more commmon than those who feel that it is wrong
(and then point out that the fact that western civilisation doesn't do it is
PROOF positive that we are more advanced) would have us believe.  Cannibalism
is often used in funeral ceremonies as a way of keeping the deceased loved one
alive.  Many other cultures (including many American Indian cultures) eat/ate
the flesh of slain enemies, often as a way of showing respect for the valor of
the departed.  Hearts are often favored for this, as it contains the spirit.

Have you ever read or seen "Alive", which is the story of the Argentinian boys
soccer team that crashed in the Andes and then ate the bodies of those who died
in order to survive?  Finger lickin good.  How about the Twighlight Zone
episode "To Serve Man"?

If you want more info on this, a good place to start is on sci.anthropology

Now send me $20 and eat my flesh,

_3,700-year tradition still glows - 
           'Assimilation in U.S. threatens ancient Zoroastrian religion'_

By Jeanne Huber, Mercury News Staff Writer

   HIGH ON A HILLSIDE above San Jose, flames leap up 24 hours a day from a
gleaming brass urn in a temple - one of only four in the United States -
dedicated to one of the world's most ancient religions.

   With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that
their faith will survive this land.

   "There is a fear - a real fear, too," said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette.
"We have one generation to do it or to die."

   Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land.
But for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.

   Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep
it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where "historical sites" are
sometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian
Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ
was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three
Zoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,
Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the
Zoroastrian prophet.

   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are 
a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a
people is very much on their minds.

   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance
of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed
by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause
their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.

   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they
actually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children
become totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than
the world at large - who will be the losers.

   "It's important to have an identity," said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,
a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  "It's important
for everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.
You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.
You can fall back on your own identity."

   For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.

   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which
animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was
only one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which
translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.

_Good vs. evil_

   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with
the good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for
good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences
such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,
kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of
men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.

   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to
follow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,
Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,
traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.

   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a
stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of
Mount Hamilton, is "Good thoughts, good words, good deeds."

   So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,
where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape
persecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;
the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.

   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India
and Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from
Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state
where others had no rights.

   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on "good
deeds" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,
the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because
Manou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up
downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's
dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the
Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.

   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an
Iranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples
in North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount
Hamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,
and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on
this continent.

   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the
property already had a large house that they have converted to a
community center.

   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet 
Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted 
ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.

   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-
in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are 
sometimes called "fire worshippers," they actually consider fire just 
a symbol of God.  "It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the 
cross and Muslims use the Holy Book," Bhujwala said.

   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all
Iranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of
the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With
Zoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious
and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the
United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.

  For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people
came to worship and revel.

   "The good things in life are not forbidden," Esfandiar Anoushiravani,
a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed
proved him right.

   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood
around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted
thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking
sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit
and nuts.

   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  "People eat the
fruit," Tarapore said.  "It's a way to participate in the ceremony."

_Santa Claus, sort of_

   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white
hair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green
symbolic of spring) and red.

   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and
played a tambourine.

   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  "This is all new for us, too,"
one told a visitor who asked what was going on.

   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with
the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have
no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their
centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu
king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his
people's religion.

   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the
San Jose temple whenever he can.

   "When I first heard about this religion," he said, "I thought, my God,
this is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.

   "People who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's the
difference with the lower animals?"

I agree, which is why I've asked for help with it.

The reason I'm working on this list is because I've recently had one
too many Christians tell me "the Bible contains no contradictions
whatsoever."  They believe that it's true, and that it describes
reality perfectly, and even predicts history before it happens.

Before I can carry on any sort of meaningful conversation with these
people, I've got to SHOW them, with concrete evidence, that the Bible
is not nearly as airtight as they thought.  I hope to do that with
this list.

Specifically: when I bring up the fact that Genesis contains two
contradictory creation stories, I usually get blank stares or flat
denials.  I've never had a fundamentalist acknowledge that there are
indeed two different accounts of creation.

Isn't that interesting?!  In the Jewish tradition you are incredibly
wrong!  They originate in the Torah and with Jewish ancestors,
specifically the Patriarch Abraham (z"l).  That knowledge was sent East
to India and China when Abraham gave "gifts" (the commentators to Jewish
scripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts) to all the rest
of his children when he sent them away to the East.  This assured that
Isaac only, who remained with Abraham, would inherit his most important
spiritual gifts, what eventually became Judaism.

So you see, other religions can have very parochial views too.  By the
Jewish view, you are very mistaken, your scripture are not scripture,
your gods are not gods, your practices a jumble of errors that lead
people to idol worship and away from God.  That doesn't stop us from
respecting you to the extent of not trying to convert you or proselytize
you and being willing to dialog in a respectful manner.  We're content
to let you live the way you care to live as long as you leave us be.  We
are happy to co-exist as long as you give us the same right.

But your incredible rudeness and violent nature seems to preclude that.
Too bad.  Is this typical of your religion?

You are a most presumptuous fellow!  How dare you presume that the
"typical" New Ager doesn't acknowledge God and is selfish.  What trite,
self-righteous, ego-ful garbage!  There are Buddhists, Christians, Jews,
and those of many other religions here on this newsgroups for whom your
words are simple slander.

Of course, from the Jewish perspective you are incredibly wrong.  We'd
say that there is no "godhead" -- just created beings who may be
enjoying a good laugh at your expense.

So not only are we selfish, we are also thieves and liars!  And you
expect any of us to pay attention to you and your "religion?"  Why not
call us more name?   Maybe then we'll all convert in gratefullness!

Boy is this guy in for a shock when he hits the real world!  Our tax rate 
is incredibly high, higher than many European countries -- it is just
packaged differently (income, Social inSecurity, Medicare, payroll taxes,
property taxes, sales taxes, fees, mandatory disability insurance, state, 
federal, local, etc. etc. etc.).  Other countries just haven't found as
many ways to hide "revenue enhancers" as our clever American politicians.

I hope you enjoy the $8K you actually get to spend from your first $25K
job out of school, Rob, you patriot you.

That is true.  It is also none of your business.  

Some people may also reason that by reading the bible and being a Xtian
you are permanently damaging your brain.  By your logic, it would be OK
for them to come into your home, take away your bible, and send you off
to "re-education camps" to save your mind from ruin.  Are you ready for

I am a living, thinking person able to make choices for myself.
I do not "need" you to show me what you think is the way; I have observed
too many errors in your thinking already to trust you to make up the
rules for me.

Because:
I set the standard for my *own* morality, and I permit you to do 
the same for yourself.  I also do not try to force you to accept my rules.

Because:
Simply because you don't like what other people are doing doesn't give you
the right to stop it, Hudson.  We are all aware that you would like for 
everyone to be like you.  However, it is obnoxious, arrogant thinking like 
yours, the "I-know-I'm-morally-right-so-I-can-force-it-on-you" bullshit 
that has brought us religious wars, pogroms against Jews, gay-bashing,
and other atrocities by other people who, like you, "knew" they were
morally right.

/(hudson)
/Aren't you?  Aren't you indicating that I should not tell other people what
to do?  Aren't you telling me it is wrong for me to do that? 

It is not a moral standard that I am presenting you with, Hudson.  It is
a key to getting along in life with other people.  It is also a point of
respect:  I trust other people to be intelligent enough to make their
own choices, and I expect the same to be returned.  You, on the other
hand, do not trust them, and want to make the choice for them--whether
they like it or not.

It is also a way to avoid an inconsistency:  if you believe that you have 
the right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives, 
then you must, by logic, admit that other people have the same right of 
interference in your life.  
(Yes, I know; you will say that your religion is correct and tells you that
only agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference.
However, other people will say that you have misinterpreted the Word of
God and that *they* are the actual true believers, and that you are
acting on your own authority.  And so it goes).





(hudson)
/Who gave
/you the authority to set such a moral standard for me to tell me that I 
/cannot set a moral standard for others?


You can set all the standards that you want, actually.  But don't be surprised
if people don't follow you like rats after the Pied Piper.  

At the most basic form, I am not going to LET you tell me what to do;
and if necessary, I will beat you to a bloody pulp before I let you actually
interfere in my life.

Now, at a more humane level than that, I recognize that all people are
sentient beings possessed of intelligence and capable of reason.  I also
recognize that they, like I, appreciate being treated with respect and
allowed to make their own decisions.

I don't believe I ever said that morality was all relative.

What I said was that I can make my mind up on my own, thank you, and that 
you don't have the right to tell others what to think.

I think that you will find that in most moral systems, there is 
a respect for human life and the dignity of the person.  It is all the
stuff besides these points that forms the core of the disagreement between 
primitive moral absolutists like yourself and the rest of us.

/(hudson)
/Why is making someone a less productive member of society immoral?

Hudson, you are screwing up again.  Morality does not (I say again, DOES
NOT) define only "right and wrong".  It also defines "acceptable social
behavior", without any overtones of good and evil.  Picking up your trash
is not really a right/wrong moral issue in the eternal sense of Good
and Evil.  Yet it is moral in the sense that it is acceptable social
behavior".  

Your definition of the word "morality" is what is causing you to trip over 
yourself here.

That is irrational thinking.  

There may also be people out there who think that death by atomic 
destruction is  a sublime and wonderful thing. I am not going to let them
execute that idea just because they want to do it. 

Simply because I let people make up their minds about what morals they
have doesn't prevent me from spotting and stopping a madman when I see
one, Hudson.  And even then, I will only stop him when he interferes 
with me and my life.  That is the difference between me and you:  you

One of the central points of any (that's ANY) moral system is that is
has to be internally consistent.  

By killing her, the character had to accept the premise that the ends
justify the means.  If he accepted that premise, then (in order to be
consistent), he must accept the idea that some day another person may
apply the same standard to HIS life.  Now, if he is unwilling to accept
this premise (which he will not be willing to accept), then he has
behaved inconsistently with his own moral standard.

Two problems right off the bat:

scout != winning the game.  Try creating the same analogy and keep the
ultimate goal the same, will you?

2.  The internal consistency question is also not addressed:  if the freshman
wants to do this to other people, then he has to accept the fact that
it may happen to him one day.  If he is unwilling, then he has violated
his own moral standard.

As I said, you appear to be the only person saying that all morality
is relative.  Most people I know do hold some absolutes in their
moral system.

I >>personally<< believe that the dignity of the individual and the right
of free will are absolutes.  I recognize that there are some moral
systems around which don't accept this; I reject them as dangerous
and anti-social (nazism, some forms of communism, fundamentalist
xtianity--no, that's not a slam).  But for the most part, almost
every moral system agrees on these two points.

Well, then answer me this:   you seem to be opposed to moral relativism
(as you call it) because it has the capacity to degenerate.  Obviously,
then, you would advocate a nonrelative (absolute) moral system.

Whose absolutist moral system do we choose?

Fine.  I can agree with most of what you typed here.  However, just because
morality gets based on something nonrelative does NOT mean that we have to
pick your xtianity as its base.

We can start a morality based on dignity of humans, freedom of choice,
tolerance, etc. and NEVER EVER rely on xtianity for anything.  Just because
someone has a consistent moral system based on true principles does not
mean that they have to involve xtianity in it.  Xtianity certainly does not
have a monopoly on principles of behavior; indeed, fewer religions are
guiltier of violating their own principles

Because you are not being consistent.  Moral systems must be consistent.

A person who thinks they can inflict pain on others, but doesn't want it 
inflicted upon themselves, has a double standard.  And double standards are
a violation of *any* moral system.

That is because two creation stories is one of the worst examples of 
a difficulty with the Bible.  "were formed" can also be translated "had been
formed" in chapter two without any problems.  So the text does not demand
that there are two creation stories.

There are two buildings in NY state with big 666 numbers on the

One in Manhattan and one near Garden City. The Garden City one

Really?  I don't get it... Genesis first says that God created the
earth, then the animals, then humans; then it turns around and says
that humans were created before animals!  How can you escape this

  take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive
  word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS 
  netters will be amiable in their explanation.)

Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin
of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say "no good"
because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not 
the authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time 
before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England, 
Professor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the 
following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring 
1993 edition):

  "I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--
  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other 
  with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian 
  or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around
  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude
  those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central
  defining characteristic of a good American might be "one who doesn't draw
  exclusive circles" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the 
  central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to
  draw a circle around "Mormon" or "Christian," to decide who is "orthodox"
  and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider
  that the central pillar of Christ's "orthodoxy" is our ability to love
  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.

  "I recently spent some time in a "Christian" bookstore in California. The
  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and
  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural
  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.
  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking 
  others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American
  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to "Cults and the
  Occult," and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same
  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found
  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers
  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous
  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations
  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).

  "It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to
  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety ("Perfect
  love casteth out fear," I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the
  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a 
  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the
  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive
  action---as the "religious right wing" has launched this year against the
  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.
  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the
  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,
  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of
  others they believe to be evil."


The above "sermon" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe
to This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who
rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His
arms.  

Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles 
of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim 
perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do 
now lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled "Christian", if 
those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are 
intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical 
scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication 
than mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the 
majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective 
voice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand
on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter 
the LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths 
and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to 
disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. 
Let us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion 
and conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.

Some Christians take a 10% discount off the Ten Commandments.  Sunday
cannot be substituted for the Sabbath.

	It isn't so much a matter of 'interpretation' of Bible texts 
that sets Mormonism apart from orthodoxy as it is a matter of 
*fabrication*.

	About 20 years ago, _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips 
in them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called "Son o' God" comics. 
It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic, there were a 
group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn, and when one of them said 
the magic word, he turned into "Son o' God." He went from a myopic, 
curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied 
portraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile 
features.	

	Now, if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus, 
and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this 
NatLamp Jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since 
this Jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.

	This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim 
that they are Christian. They profess faith in Jesus, but the Jesus 
that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the 
NatLamp Jesus was.

No matter how "absurd" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by
mankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common
moral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of
any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a
workable moral system created for everyday use.

The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing
every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of
Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial
Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance
of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.

It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-
Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from
the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well
be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to
follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was
written down by man.

This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the
divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many
different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the
fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do
that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an
agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit
society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take
the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create
and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables
the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers
have done).

Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I
think the important aspect is the result.

David.

The primary problem in human nature is a "fragmentation of being."
Humans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. Good and
evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.

The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of
being. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's
rebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of
the Scriptures.

Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words
of St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was
that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the
Eastern Orthodox Church, this is called "theosis," or "deification."

One can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,
and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture
of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs
was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the
Creator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,
their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly
irreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in
their lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This
is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.

The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it
were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,
its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.

Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of
innocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining
of self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His
masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?

God must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral
value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There
is no other way to achieve union with God.

Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.
He was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,
and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,
not in His essence, but in His energies.

The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it
with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the
answer to his dilemma in vs 25.

  No, for the excellent reason that there IS no such commandment.

  Aside from that, please note that the Abrahamic literary tradition
  is strong on narrative, light on dialog, and virtually nonexistent

Your last remark is a contradiction, but I'll let that pass.

I was addressing the notion of the Great Commission, which
you deleted in order to provide us with dull little homilies.
Thank you, Bing Crosby.  Now you go right on back to sleep
and mommy and daddy will tuck you in later.

Oh, and how convenient his bible must have been to Michael
Griffin, how convenient his Christianity.  "Well, I'll just
skip the bit about not murdering people and loving the sinner
and hating the sin and all that other stuff for now and
concentrate on the part where it says that if someone is doing
something wrong, you should shoot him in the back several times
as he tries to hobble away on his crutches."

I'll leave the "convert or die" program of the missionaries and
their military escorts in the Americas for Nadja to explain as
she knows much more about it than I.

Must be awfully convenient, by the way, to offer platitudes
as you have done, David, rather than addressing the arguments.

As someone who works with protists, this does not strike me as being true.
Are you confusing this with:

1) Ciliates which have a macronucleus and a micronucleus, each containing
DNA (but in different amounts). The micronucleus is involved in mitosis 
and meiosis, the macronucleus seems to be the main "control center" of
the cell; or

2) Two groups of unrelated protists, euglenoids and dinoflagellates, which
seem to have permanently condensed chromosomes.  How these groups read
their DNA is quite a puzzle, as most models of how genes work involve 
the chromosomes being unwound.

I have heard that the sabbath was originally determined by the phases of

Good question.  I don't have a nice concise answer, though.  What about the
child whose parents are crushed emotionally because he/she starts a carerr
doing something they greatly dislike.  It is the same kind of harm, and
is probably "caused" by the same thing:  The desire of the child to be 
true to his or her self.

What is more important, being true to yourself or burying that truth within
you in order to maintain peace in the family?

hard question, no good answer.

Ahhhhh, but that *is* the point.   Honor should demand that each of them
recognize that there is error/fault/misunderstanding aplenty in the
situation, and to apologize to each other.

But, since there is no honor *between* the two of them, they hold to
their own thickheaded paths, refusing to recognize each other as human,
and dragging the family feud out into the future.

Honor is both an individual trait, and a contract *between* two or more
folk.

I was wrong. I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus
confused "kleros", the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of
land discussed.  In actuality it is "chorion", which is the last word Acts
1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss "chorion" so I
cannot report as to the nuances of the word.
 
I don't know if someone else would have caught this, though I am sure that
someone would be able to do so, but I have an aversion to disseminating
mistakes, especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point"

MY REPLY...
Good point.  But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you
have produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dug
deeper.  I'm glad you have begun in this post.  I will begin Greek studies on
these passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well.

"It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as

But are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  Let's
see, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other
passages, we see that he has also used (b).  On the other hand he has
presented no use of:
 
(d) historical context                or
(e) historical content                or
(f) other pertinent historical info   or

Thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings."
 
MY REPLY...
Question:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on starting
to use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present
shallow observations (I don't mean this in a bad way).
At this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a
total exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating
around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe
it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re:
Judas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use
several of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also.
It will greatly enhance our study of these passages.

MY REPLY...
The reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that the
PASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one
another.
(1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention;
(2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look
at your defense of this later.
 
Also, the "reward of iniquity" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of
silver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at
stating why you believe it is).
 
At this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural
groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.
 
DB...
"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage
as he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so
that both could be considered correct."
 
MY REPLY...
One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is
that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these
passages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's
explanation of Judas' death...
 
_____________________________________________________________________
 
HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING
HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND "FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN"
=============================================================
 
This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are
constantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent
discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.
Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is
destroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at
all.
Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and
was crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do
they necessarily contradict each other?
Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that
Judas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling
something black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be
true and supplementary.
A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the
edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there
for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas
fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.
The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this
explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the
valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see
rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.
There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.
Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on
this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are
not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced
was the decomposition of his body before his fall.
Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.
This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a
pistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at
the same time.
On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting
himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping
form the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the
case of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a
situation of different perspectives of the same event.
 
_____________________________________________________________________
 
Your only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit
inerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.
Here's what you said in an earlier post...

"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so
opposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.  But you seem to
find Tony Rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David
Joslin's."

Here, you discredit Tony's explanation based on what you deem too "heavy" for
the passages.  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can say
it's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it
didn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.
 
Questions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or
are either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an
alleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe
in this respect.

Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer
it because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out
that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a
bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy
movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging."
 
MY REPLY...
I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a
call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother
is on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a
local hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.
 
To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is
"begging the question", if I may quote you.
 
[Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian
Research Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these
terms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM
show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]
 
DB...
"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other
qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself."
 
MY REPLY...
Qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention
below.
Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we
have re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's
synonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But
he lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can
discover.

So it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony's
position.  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?
 
Also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or
deceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done
with Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including
their "interpretation" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find
some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.
 
You also noted they "interpreted" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although
that is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember,
that's the first criteria we must examine.

No you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly
probable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.
 
The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New
Testament.
 
In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),
it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : "Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was
not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his
city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he
was buried in his father's tomb."             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel "hanged himself" [Gr. Sept.,
APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, "and died".  Here we have no doubt of the
result.
In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.
 
Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply
means "hang oneself".

_____________________________________________________________________
Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable
explanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria),
I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.
 
MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,
and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and
said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the
price of blood." And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's
field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of
Blood to this day.
 
First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of
hanging. All it says is that he "went and hanged himself." Luke however, in
Acts, tells us that "and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all
his entrails gushed out." This is a pretty clear indication (along with the
other details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle,
etc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that

Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed.
Let's look at the passage in Matthew:
 
MAT 27:4 saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." And they said,
"What is that to us? You see to it!"
 
MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,
and went and hanged himself.
 
MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, "It is not
lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood."
 
MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field,
to bury strangers in.
 
MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
 
Notice verse 5..."Then he...went and hanged himself."
Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a
result of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
What does Acts say?
ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and
falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.
 
ACT 1:20 "For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be
desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'
 
Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line of
reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the "two" accounts of Judas'
death is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
say Judas "hanged himself", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the
hanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no
contradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.

MY REPLY...
...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records
his death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging
and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be
the case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a
                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
______________________________________________________________________
 
I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but
in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however,
highly probable.                            ^^^^^^
 
DB...
"By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had
different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One
simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as
the correct version in both Matt and Acts.  "The Biblical Knowledge Commentary"
suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly
exploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope
broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain
how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first)."
 
MY REPLY...
The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person
was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may
have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell
upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a
superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not
given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted
post gave us some...
 
_____________________________________________________________________
A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the
edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there
for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas
fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.
The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this
explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the
valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see
rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.
There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.
Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on
this way down, tearing his body open.

Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the
source of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is
correct: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist
who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to
thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the
prophesy of the Potter's field came from)."
 
MY REPLY...
Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss
this with you.
 
DB...
As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the
money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather
than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically
mention "the reward of iniquity" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions
what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 "...concerning
Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.").  Now I would point out
that when the Bible describes an act of "iniquity," and then immediately
discusses "*the* reward of iniquity," it would be rather inane to suggest that
it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed."
 
MY REPLY...
Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!
 
ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples
(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,
ACT 1:16 "Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy
Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide
to those who arrested Jesus;
ACT 1:17 "for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry."
ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and
falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.
ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field
is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)
ACT 1:20 "For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be
desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'
 
Notice that in verse 16, the word "iniquity" is not used.  Rather, it states
that Judas "became a guide to those who arrested Jesus".
But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, "for he was numbered with us and
obtained a part in this ministry."  What part did Judas play in their ministry?
         ^^^^^^
JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a
thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.
JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had
said to him, "Buy those things we need for the feast," or that he should give
something to the poor.
 
So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.
Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,
according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of "wages of
iniquity" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen
by Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical
explanation of what the "wages of iniquity" are.  What do you think, Dave?

I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from
others, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do
not feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in
this example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research
specifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not
as tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am
not competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns
out that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich "Greek Lexicon" renders
each verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical
order.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is
far from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes
things a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is
indeed "chorion." 

Now I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:

	"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament," Louw and Nida
	"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament"
	"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament," Grimm
	"Word study Concordance," Tynsdale
	"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other 
	 early Christian Writings," Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich
	"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon," Perschbacher

In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:

	A space, place, region, district, field, area, "country place," 
	land, farm, estate, "a bit of tillage", and similar meanings.

Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about "grave." As some of these 
books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books 
are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I 
think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into "contradictions" to 
be once again, as your friend said it, "lacking in substance," and thus Archer 
is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would 
have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them
to support Mr Archer's contentions). 

By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of
"agros," the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word
"agros" is defined as "a field in the country." Chorion is specifically noted
as a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly
Bullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for "field" in Matthew
(ie: agros) is different from the word for "field" in Acts (ie: chorion), and
thus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already
admit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity
which drives the point home). 

So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise
(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this 
particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer
questions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and 
the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in
discussing the "Potter's Field."

Actually, if you do further research as to the Greek word "apacgw," you will
find that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellent
reason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I
recently checked several Lexicons:

	"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament," Louw and Nida
	"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament"
	"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament," Grimm
	"Word study Concordance," Tynsdale
	"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other 
	 early Christian Writings," Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich
	"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon," Perschbacher

A couple simply stated "hanged oneself", and a couple were more explicit 
and stated that "apacgw" means specifically "kill yourself by hanging." A
couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for "apacgw" is
"strangle, throttle or choke" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who
suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best
references though, "Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New
Testament," not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the
literal translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also
other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give
further context).  

The word "apagchw" has two root words: "gchw" is the "to strangle" root, and
the root word "apo" means literally "away." This root words is included in
words which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the
greek word "apagello" means to send a message).  "Apo" can also denote a
change in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson
specifically makes comparison to the word "apokteiuo," which means "to kill."
In literal meaning the word "apacgw" means "to throttle, strangle to put out
of the way," and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from
life, to death).  So while the word "apacgw" does mean "to hang," it
specifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he
state that it means "to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging." He then
notes the the use of "apacgw" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He
presents that example of "apacgw" as being used to explicitly mean "suicide by
hanging." Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the
added denotation of "death," and as you insist that the Bible was written by
God, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete
meaning of "apacgw" (ie: Since the word "apacgw" was used, then death is
denoted as the result). 

By the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of "apacgw":

> In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),

Note Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to
Greek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie" the the
Hebrew say "and died"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. 
It should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added "and died", the
correct translation would still be "apacgw," as the man did indeed die from
strangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the
Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions
which contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily
executed by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it
now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove
your point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing
"apacgw" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless
assertions without corresponding evidence. 

Now I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it
one of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,
I think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above
what the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or
historical source to justify it. 

By the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:

> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.

Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that
there are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description
of the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to
assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two
thousand years ago (after all, things change). 

Now as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same
as the 30 silvers:

>          ^^^^^^

True, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas' betrayal
"an iniquity," but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas'
actions "an iniquity" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took
the money box, but rather said:

    "Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling
     him "Buy what we need for the feast"; or that he should give something
     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and
     it was night."

Note that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money
box.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose
the a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different
book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by
the author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. 

Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen
evidence that "apacgw" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was
successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because
Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:
Passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself
the next day.  Thus the money which bought the "Field of Blood" would have to
have been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver
that night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, I
believe that the house of cards is comming down). 

Maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on
Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.

By the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: the
mention of it in Matthew), you say:

> Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss
> this with you.

I am reminding you now to discuss it now. It's all part of the same verse we
are discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping 
these issues.

    PS. I would note again, that you are not stating that that Bible
    is not possibly inerrant; you are stating that it *IS* inerrant.
    Since you have been, by your own admission, presenting merely "possible"
    reconciliations (I of course don't rate them that highly), then the 
    best you can do is say that the Bible is "possibly" inerrant, not that 
    it *is* inerrant.

Here's the real problem.  Americans have become so insensitive to the needs
of others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see
straight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious
moral decisions based on reality.

If a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is not
considered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man has
fled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned
away from his responsibility to his wife and child.

However, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden,
she is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman
suffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life.
When the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed
out, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that
he wishes he could trade places with his child.

Ths root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, "My
feelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung."
And when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of.
It's the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his
demons for all of eternity.  Let any one of us unrepentant into heaven, and
we'll ruin it the first chance we get.

: Now, I don't really know the answer to these questions, but I've got a real
: good guess.
: 

And, it's probably right.

: And I wouldn't call *that* 'benevolent', either.
: 

It is a move in the right direction.  As it is now, we don't see our
responsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The media
backs us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.  The only
"responsibility" that sells in the marketplace is that which is just
enough to make us "feel responsible" without showing anything that
might show us our own true irresponsibility.  We want to "feel" like
good people, but we want nothing with *being* good people.  Just give
me the freedom to say "I'm good", and the rest of the world can burn.
Rape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where
poor old folks rot until they're dead.  I'll hate my brother and sister
if I wish and I'll cheat on my wife or husband.  Screw the government,
because it screws me, and don't talk to me about giving to the church
because church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites.
But, I'm a good person.  At least I admit what I do.  At least I love
myself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world--not that
a man lay down his life for his brother...That sounds too "christian".

At the root, this is the substance of what hell is made of.

We've become a self indulgant, backslidden society no longer responsible
to our children, to our parents, to our families, to our government, or
to our God.  This is the root behind justification of every evil, of every
corruption in government, of every slanderous remark, of every lie, and
of every murder.  Society cannot continue to live like this long.  it will
have to destroy itsself soon, and perhaps in the end, that will be the
biggest blessing this world can hope to see.

Why do people see so much evil in trying to turn this situation around?

The most recent reason given by the Clinton Administration for
calling for federally funded abortions is that many private
health insurance programs offer coverage for abortion.

The following are two form letters regarding this.  Please send

RE: Abortion and my health insurance coverage


TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

I recently have become aware that my health insurance includes
coverage for abortion.  I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of
conscience.  It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums may
be being used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is
murder.  I would like to request that I be exempted from abortion
coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly.

                              Sincerely,



My policy number is:

To your state and national representatives:





RE: Abortion and health coverage

Dear 


It has recently come to my attention as a result of the current
abortion debate that my health insurance coverage provided by my
employer may include coverage paying for abortions.  

I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of conscience and am
disturbed greatly that my coverage may be being used in this
manner.  However, I depend on my employers' provided health
coverage, and fear that if I speak up about it, that I may lose
not only my coverage but even my job.

I would like to ask you to put into law the provision that health
insurance providers make abortion coverage non-compulsory in
their health insurance program, so that it can be declined, with
an appropriate reduction in premium.

In order that there be no difference in the dollar ammount in the
health benefit packages between those who would choose to have
abortion coverage and those who would not, I further ask that you
include a provision in which the reduction in premium resulting
from the declining of "abortion coverage" be paid-out to the
employee, rather than pocketed by the employer.  

This second provision should serve to dissuade employers from
pressuring employees into taking one or the other stand with
regard to abortion services.  Thank you very much.  Your fellow
citizen.

                                   Sincerely,

I noticed this dead horse in your Keywords line. Is this the famous scarlet horse
of Babylon that the Beast (that's 666 for you illuminatti) rides on in those
wonderful mediaeval manuscripts. If so, I fear your announcement that the old
girl is dead may be premature. I bet $20 on her to place in the 6th race at The
Downs last Sunday, and she slid in a bad fifth. So she is not dead. She is just
comatose. (like god that way, I suppose).

Almost one third of the world's population claim to be Christian.  But
any similarity between their beliefs and lifestyle to the first century
model is purely coincidental.  At Luke 18:8 it states, "...nevertheless,
when the son of man returns, will he really find the faith on the earth?"

You must be using 'values' to mean something different from the way I
see it used normally.

And you are certainly using 'Science' like that if you equate it to
"the real world".

Science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe
and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning
those perceptions.

It has nothing to do with values as far as I can see.
Values are ... well they are what I value.
They are what I would have rather than not have - what I would experience
rather than not, and so on.

Objective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are
applicable to everyone.

I don't agree.
Science is useful insofar as it the predictions mentioned above are
accurate.  That is insofar as what I think *will be* the effect on
my perceptions of a time lapse (with or without my input to the Universe)
versus what my perceptions actually turn out to be.

But values are about whether I like (in the loosest sense of the word) the 
perceptions :-)

>Simple theories with accurate predictions could not objectively be said
>to be more useful than a set of tarot cards.  

I don't see why.
'Usefulness' in science is synonomous with 'accuracy' - period.
Tarot predictions are not useful because they are not accurate - or
can't be shown to be accurate.
Science is useful because it is apparently accurate.

Values - objective or otherwise - are beside the point.

No?

Looking at [1] we find that during Roman times "Tyre vied with Sidon
for first place in the intellectual life of the period"; that Tyre was
the seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it;
that "the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia" was the
basilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for its
exports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre,
along with other seaports, "provided outlets for South Arabian, Indian
and even Chinese trade"; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing
population by "following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line
of growth" (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyre
established colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a "small
fishing village" by any stretch of the imagination.

Centuries later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had "opulent and flourishing
bazaars" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was
"noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware."
During the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held
by Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)

In [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: "other
*major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and
Zahlah."  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of
the Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982)
on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's
withdrawel in 1984, "Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local
economy."

If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present,
why is it always called a city (or, above, a "major city")?  Why
does it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities
in Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the
list (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?

A one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse.
(Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They
may even use cars these days. :-) 

The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says "Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000."  
Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range.
(One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same
source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also,
so I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for
the cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the
population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In
particular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.

I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed.
Don't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to 
the other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make
a case for Tyre having been singled out?

They had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]:
Tyre "receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes
and from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a
large series of coins, occasionally in gold ..."

The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fit
your characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems
to have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching
when you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small
fishing village.

>Who is Josh McDowell.

A Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low.
He happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian,
_Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969).
The same sentence, in fact.  He defends the fulfillment of the
prophecy using the same argument you are using, an argument that
I haven't seen in print anywhere else, which is why I jumped to
the conclusion that you were quoting Josh.

(I tried to find the Jidejian book, but it isn't listed in Books
in Print.  Can you tell me more about it? Her descriptions are so
much at odds with everything else I've read; I'm curious to know why.)

Tony-

While I honestly believe you believe you are doing a "good thing" by posting
that piece of propaganda, I believe the more people believe that the more they
will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people.  I
have seen the film called "The Gay Agenda" and along with my church we found
it to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of
editting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia
familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people
are actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither
you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as
many as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life
I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something
obviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are
innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an
abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not
support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian
Fundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants
your report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed
homosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that
there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list.
I do not feel threatened by gays, I don't understand why others are.

The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-
istries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.

THE FOUNDER OF AN "EX-GAY" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO

by Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)

In December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa
awards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE
INDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering
discontented gays and lesbians "a way out of the homosexual death-style"
through prayer.  "I'd like to give the award back," Caligiuri now laughs, "I'm
no longer deserve it."
  Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national "ex-gay" movement peaked
with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well
as Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-
gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  "There's no reality
in it," he says, "I was selling a product, and my product was a lie."
  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the
organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again
Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who
are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their
sexual urges and embracing Christianity.  "We offer support to people who are
seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality," explains Bob Davies, director of
Exodus.  He ventures that "about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-
sexuality are men."
  "Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting
their time," says Lisa Seeley, a former "redeemed lesbian" who worked with
Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  "These
organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded."
  "It's possible to change your identity or your behavior," says sex educator
Brian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. "But it's really impossible to
change your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,
but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings."
  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all
hell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both
their romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted
by a man he picked up in a bar.  "I was really drunk," he recalls, "and I
went home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all
night, and the next morning he raped me again."
  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the
home he shared with his ex-lover.  "He had another man there with him,"
Caligiuri recalls.  "I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay is
about, I don't want to be this way anymore."
  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery
with others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's
gay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its
first public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,
Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed
for hell.
  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks
in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  "We were listed
under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services," Caligiuri says, "so people
thought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out
where the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo-
sexuality."  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,
adding, "They'll do anything to reach these people."
  "David used to go on radio and say really stupid things," recalls Peter
Kelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, "like that
he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors."
  Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on
Raphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  "They were relieved," he recalls.
"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better
that I should be a 'reformed' gay person."
  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  "By the time I appeared on Sally's
show," "I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline
and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their
father.  I was horny all the time."
  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his
numerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he "used to go to bookstores
and get blowjobs."  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping
with other "reformed" homosexuals.
  "I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex
with one another," Caligiuri says.  "We'd go to conferences in other cities,
and we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody
else."
  By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988,
Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show's
host asked him if he ever "acted on temptation," his answer was a lie.
  Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He was
suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating
yeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  "I was too sick
to go to church," he explains.  "The more time I spent away from those people
the more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be."
  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local
church and closed the ministry's doors.  "I'd convinced myself that there
is no need in the world for ex-gay people," he says.
  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities ("I'm interest-
ed in belief systems that aren't judgemental."), considering romance ("But
not with a CHristian!"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.
"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes," he says.  "I want to
eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I
may have brought to our community."

---end article---

Caligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles
of former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th
similar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have
come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,
like Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian "Lazarus Project" of West
Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community
to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values
of sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become
and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as "Love In
Action" and others, who either once claimed to have been "reformed" or who
were too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed
in them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of "sealing" their
new heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses
and bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of
night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous "sin"
through a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch
has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-
cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet
the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow
gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also
mrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and
fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on
them, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain
functions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-
place.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the
threat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's
_"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact
based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as
Maury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  I
seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and
self-acceptance.

Thank you.

Although I'm an atheist, the events in Waco have really sickened me.  It's
truely a sad day for religious freedom in this country.  The Branch
Dividians may have been nutty (my general opinion of all religious people),
but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not grounds
for destroying a people.

The killing of the four BATF agents was surey a dispicable act, but that was
an escalation of the confrontation which the BATF started.  War is bad
precisely because of humanity's tendancy for escalation.  That principle
applies to all cases of warfare- whether it's between nuclear superpowers,
feuding families or fledgling religious groups and our federal govt.  Why
was warfare chosen as the course of action when patience and subtlety would
also have worked?  Why is the petty letter of the law more important than
peoples' lives and religious beliefs?  Perhaps the supposed professionals in
our federal law inforcement agencies are just plain stupid.

It was interesting to watch the 700 club today.  Pat Robertson said that the
"Branch Dividians had met the firey end for worshipping their false god." He
also said that this was a terrible tragedy and that the FBI really blew it. 
However, I still feel that he's forgetting that every major religion in the
world had a similarly humble 'cult-status' beginning- even, and perhaps
especially, christianity.  It is perhaps worthwhile to consider that the
Branch Dividians' apocalyptic prophecies have been fulfilled.  Maybe David
Koresh really was Jesus Christ (sure sounds like a neat opening epic for a
new major religion to me).

Let's see, if Alexander destroyed Tyre, and people move back, and
they construct houses, and after a while 14000 people live there
and still call it Tyre, it is not considered to be rebuilt. Instead
it's considered to be 'just-some-people-that-got-together-for-fishing-
and-they-needed-houses' place.

Sigh, I was never born in a city then (my home town has 10.000
people). I have to consult my city and inform them that it's from
now a fishing village. When this city (Kristinestad) was founded
in the 17:th century about 1000 people lived there, so the norms
were even more bizarre for dumb Swedish queens who founded cities
along the coast of Finland.

I would like to know why Paul thought is was worth mentioning the 
small fishing place of Tyre in Acts. Again, maybe he was a keen
fisherman and wanted to visit the shores of Tyre? :-)

Cheers,
Kent

  Lev 17:11: For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given
  it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is
  the blood that makes atonement for the soul.

The Old Testament was very big on the "eye for an eye" business.  It
makes sense that Leviticus would support physical injury to "repay"
moral wrongdoing.

I know about sanctification.  I've been taught all about it in Sunday
school, catechism class, and theology classes.  But even after all
that, I still can't accept it.  Maybe I'm still not understanding it,
or maybe I'm just understanding it all too well.

From the bottom of my heart I know that the punishment of an innocent
man is wrong.  I've tried repeatedly over the course of several years
to accept it, but I just can't.  If this means that I can't accept the
premise that a god who would allow this is 'perfectly good', then so
be it.

If you can explain to me why the death of Jesus was a *good* thing,
then I would be very glad to hear it, and you might even convert me.
Be warned, however, that I've heard all the most common arguments
before, and they just don't convince me.

Guido, before you have a hemmorage, maybe we can lighten up, Ok. You
have opinions as do I. Flaming at each other will not get us anywhere in
the understand of our respective positions. I offer a hand of
friendship, a truce, if it may, so that maybe we can start this
conversation like gentelmen (I am sorry if that was a mistake, from your
name I can't tell gender, you know us stupid Americans). Since you have
replied to my wife's post you must have some strong feelings about this
issue. I would like to hear them, and understand them if I can. In
return all I ask is for you to listen to me, and try to understand why I
feel the way I do.
All the yelling and all the hate about this issue just drives the sides
farther apart, till they forget why they started the fight in the first
place. If you and I can forster an understand and mutual respect for
each others views than maybe, and only then really can we come up with a
solution that is acceptable to us both.

To the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the
truth than is objectivism, it provides more power and ability to
control events.

Assuming, for the moment, that morals _are_ relative, then two
relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute
truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that
produces the desired results.

Assuming that there is an absolute morality, two disagreeing 
objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right; there
is no room for compromise.  Once you beleive in absolute morals,
you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees
with you is amoral.

Given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention,
I'd say that compromise seems to be "better".

Reduced?  Abortion is a lot cheaper than pre-natal care and birth.
If you wanted to pay the higher premiums that would result if everyone
using their health insurance to pay for an abortion instead elected to
carry to term, I'm pretty sure that your insurance carrier would be
happy to take your money.

I would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post.

In retrospect I would also like to quote another source: Douglas C.
Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_

THERAPY INEFFECTIVE

Recently the founders of yet another prominent "ex-gay" ministry, Exodus
International, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective.
Michael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and lovers
for 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The
program was described by these men as "ineffective . . . not one person was
healed."  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent
feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were
driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed "reparative therapy."

The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June
30, 1992 called "The Ex-Ex-Gay" by Robert Pela.

Some personal thoughts:

It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major
portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among
its ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all
they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to
save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even
later, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and
segragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.
Today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is
still coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind
control, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than
God sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt
thier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is "physically" forced
to stay in this "reparative therapy" but sheer social pressure is enough for
many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.

As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution
against gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by
the contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,
not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t
a clue what is in their heart.

For those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them
please contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians
And Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of
people comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends
who have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to
a parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some "first-hand" real life and
loving understanding.  God's love and understanding for Gay people is no
less abundant.

Thank you.
PAX

I was curious to check out how many San Jose Mercury News mentioned
Tyre (1990-92). Here's the outcome from the research (condenced versions,
copyright San Jose Mercury news):

---
  Bombings in the two largest cities in southern Lebanon killed 11 people
and 
wounded 80 others. A car bomb blew up in Tyre, killing 10 people and
wounding 
75. A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in 
Nabatiye.
---
  An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off

southern Lebanon early today, killing the two men aboard, the army command 
said.
  
     It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the 
motorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as hostile. The
army 
said no one on the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain 
guerrillas was not immediately known.
---
  Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu
Nidal 
battled Sunday in Tyre, Lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled 
grenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said.
---
 Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had 
uncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said
pro-
Iranian kidnappers had held Western hostages.
  
     Officials of the militia, Amal, led local journalists through the
catacomb-
like alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village, 
Kawthariyet al Siyad, near Tyre, the ancient port city, about 40 miles
south of 
Beirut.
  
     The officials said they were certain that U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William
R. 
Higgins was detained there shortly after he was seized by gunmen on a road 
outside Tyre in February 1988.
--------------
...anyway, I counted 20 articles during these 3 years of reporting. I also
found out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of the
city is defined between 14000 and 24000. It seems that Tyre is one of the
places
where people from Libanon flee to during more extensive bombings, so
there's
a constant flow of refugees entering and leaving Tyre (articles mentioned
thousands of people entering and leaving this place).

I counted 0 articles for my home town, Kristinestad, so from now I will
consider this place to be a fishing village :-).

Cheers,
Kent

(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMAD SAW)       
(SAW: PEACE AND BLESSINGS BE UPON HIM)

In His Name (ALLAH) , Be He (ALLAH) Glorified!
There is Nothing But Glorifies His (ALLAH's) Praise.

In The Name Of  Allah, The Compassionate, The Merciful

   "He is who has sent His Messenger with
guidance and the religion of truth  to make it
supreme over all religion:  and sufficient is Allah
as a Witness.  Muhammad is the Messenger of
Allah, and those who are with him are firm
against the unbelievers and merciful among
each other.  You will see them bowing and
prostrating  themselves, seeking Allah's grace
and His pleasure.  Their mark is on their face
the sing of prostrafion; this is their similitude in
the Torah and Indgil." [the Our'an 48:28-29]

   Since the Nineteenth and Thirhy-first Words
concerning the mission of Muhammad (SAW) prove his
prophethood with decisive evidences, we assign the
verification of that subject to those Words.
   As a supplement to them, we will merely show here
in Nineteen Signs, some  of the flashes of that great
truth.

   FIRST SIGN:  The Owner and Master of this universe
does everything with knowledge, disposes every affair
with wisdom, directs everything all-seeingly, treats
everything all-knowingly, and arranges in everything with
His will and wisdom such causes, purposes and uses that
are apparent to us.  Since the One who creates knows,
surely the One who knows will speak, since He will
speak, surely He will speak to those who have
consciousness, thought, and speech.  Since He will speak
to those who have thought, surely He will speak to
humankind, whose make-up and awareness are more
comprehensive of all conscious beings.  Since He will
speak to humankind, surely He will speak to the most
perfect of mankind and those most worthy of address and
highest in morality, and who are qualified to guide
humanity; then He will certainly speak to Muhammad (SAW), 
who, as friend and foe alike testify, is of the highest 
character and morality, and who is obeyed by one fifth
of humanity, to whose spiritual rule half of the globe has
submitted, with the radiance of whose light has been
illumined the future of mankind for thirteen centuries, to
whom the believers, the luminous segment of humanity,
renew their oath of allegiance five times a day, for
whose happiness and peace they pray, for whom they call
down Allah's blessings and bear admiration and love in
their hearts.

   Certainly, He will speak to Muhammad (SAW),
and Indeed He has done so;  He will make him the
Messenger, and Indeed He has done so; He will make
him the guide for the rest of humanity, and Indeed He
has done so.

Compare the Driver to an urge such as Jealousy, where there is an urge
and an "object". The jealousy does not technically exist until the object
is apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there
even though it is not detectable.

Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but
I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions
can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven't attempted to
define the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of
each Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a
similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is
easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I
misunderstood?

My p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and
his writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do
my bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth)
is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this
will probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the
list of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element
may come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his
transactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what
gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.

I've had some more thoughts on my definitions:

I've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions
in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of
the Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a
graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of
frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the
spectrum over time.

Conscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the
reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature
because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often
unwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given
time which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with
Freud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the
urges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego,
I suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why
Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is "what
provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?". I think I need some
more time with this one.

That's about it for now!

	In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and

determination for devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take
place.

	Samadhi means ``fixed mind.'' The Vedic dictionary, the Nirukti,
says, samyag adhiyate 'sminn atma-tattva-yathatmyam: ``When the mind is
fixed for understanding the self, it is said to be in samadhi.''
Samadhi is never possible for persons interested in material sense
enjoyment, nor for those who are bewildered by such temporary things.
They are more or less condemned by the process of material energy.

Yep, that's pretty much it. I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the
Jewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between
YHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral
Code to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries
fall, though.

As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was
required, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that
the Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of
the required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).

The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between
Man and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate
anything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).

The trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the "created
in His image" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and
have still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if
one wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors
unashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about
Jesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives
by his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.
Revelation aside, one can only "know" Christ second-hand or worse.

This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way
initially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible
to interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where
Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.

No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple
moral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral
code. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child
may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told
the child that it is "wrong". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in
the pub or bar (where there are no children). The "wrongness" here is if
the child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is "inappropriate"
to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of
animals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that
he is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but
you get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive
as absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.

I think that you are changing the meaning of "values" here. Perhaps
it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.

value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods
or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in 
usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality
considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as
of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus. 
The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or
lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech
sound. 

In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms
of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that
these definitions do not mean the same thing.

In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a
reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the
word "value" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard
of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its
basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one
concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on
systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a
scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as
"objective values."

Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow.
Just because the word "values" is used in both contexts does not mean
that there is a relationship between the two contexts.

If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must
first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering
the meaning of the word "objective" I doubt that this will ever happen.

So, back to the original question:

And objective morality is.....?

If you can provide an objective foundation for "morality" then that will
be a good beginning.

#You are making a ludicrous suggestion.

As a Latter-day Saint, I found John's statement *not at all* ludicrous...

Please allow me to explain myself.  In 1838, the governor of Missouri,
governor Boggs, issued his so-called "Mormon extermination order."  The
only crime ("illegal activity") the Latter-day Saints had committed, was
their religious affiliation, their anti-slave stance (Missouri still
allowed slave practices), and their growing numbers/influence in Missouri.

I guess the Mormons "got what they deserved," because they refused to bow
to the will of (corrupt and evil) secular authorities. This "disobedience"
brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion from
their lands and settlements...

In the 1850s, the so-called "Utah-War" was forced upon the early Mormon
settlers, and their "illegal activities" consisted no less in living as
their conscience dictated, and to be sovereign/independant in Utah's
(or "Deseret Territory" as it was called at the time) constitutional
daily affairs.  (In order to subdue this clear threat to the survival of
the United States of America, an entire army under the command of General
Johnson (hence "Johnson's Army"), invaded the territory to "restore"
Uncle Sam's law and order...)

History has the uncanny ability to draw certain parallels between events
that might appear unrelated, but are very much the same in spirit and
intent.  That same mob- or persecution-prone attitude is to be found in
this user-group: when we tried to organize "soc.religion.mormon" and/or
"talk.religion.mormon," a whole bunch of "charitable" believers effectively
blocked our intent to create a group to discuss topics related to Mormonism
et al in an appropriate forum.  We really must be a "threat" to various
establishments...  Frustrating our legitimate rights for proper representa-
tion also belongs in the category of persecution.  It is ironic that those
who oppose us, point to all kinds of "justifications" to do so, despite
their claims of adhering to a gospel of love...

In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and
I don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of their
lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from
being trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  I
may be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the
case. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds church
leader), strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-"Peace Keeper"
missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another "inspired" decision from
secular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enough
for the feds to back off.

Lest anyone believe I do not believe in government: I do, but NOT without
questioning the wisdom and constitutionality of their decisions and
resolves.  The government's actions around the Mt. Carmel compound in Waco
was NOT wise, neither was it necessary.  David Koresh did NOT pose a great
threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation, and with
John, I too wonder who or what's next...

Who killed who?  What constitutional right did the ATF officers have to

What REALLY caused the "murder" of the little children?  Could it be that
the ATF/FBI presence has any bearing upon the events?  How would you
interpret the Mt. Masada events?  --Blame the Jews?  (What the heck did
the Romans do there anyway?  What business did the ATF/FBI has in Waco,
Texas???)  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society.

David Koresh, no doubt, will be described as the "evil" guy (by the
executioners), while the actions of all those "valiant and brave" officers
may have been "regrettable," but alas, "necessary" to serve some dubious
public/national interest. --I guess they are still figuring it out how to

Larry,

One pays insurance to pay for coverage one expects/fears one might need.
If one is opposed to abortion, one should not be required to pay for
"coverage" of it because one will NEVER want to use that "service" and
neither should that person be COMPELLED to pay for other people's
abortions PARTICULARLY if one sincerely believes that abortion is
murder.

Don't understand the concept of insurance, do you Anthony?

What is insurance for?

To spread the cost of illness/accident/etc that does occur in a small
percentage of cases, over many.  Those who do not face the accident/etc
have peace of mind that they would not be devestated if they did, those
who do face the accident/etc *are* not devestated (financially anyhow) 
in dealing with it.

This 'irresponsible' label in reference to normal but rare life occurances is
stupid.  Bad things happen to good people, too, you know.

Subject:    Catholic Right & Pat Robertson
Lines: 49

The Roman Catholic conservatives are coming out in the open to line
up with Pat Robertson and his ultra Right Wing Christian Coalition.
Former Secretary of Education William Bennet, a Roman Catholic, stood
beside the Christian Coalition's spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 3
conference in Washington.  The purpose of the conference was to
publish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed
to prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it
backed away from the "Family Values" positons of the '92 convention.

Conservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson's organization
with political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications
support.

The Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version
of the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes.
Ms. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom
Council in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.

Ms. Elwell was hired by Domino's Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989
to manage Legatus, a "nonpolitical", Catholic businessmen's group.
Membership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4
million in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts
at Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the
Catholic Campaign.

The Campaign's list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep.
Robert K. Dornan, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, the lovely
Pat Buchanan and Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus.   Also on the national
committee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson's
American Center for Law and Justice.  Another Catholic, Thomas
Patrick Monaghan, senior counsel of Robertson's ACLJ, is also an
active supporter of the Catholic Campaign.

The board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare, broadcasting exec
and former U.S. ambassador to the Pope, Wall Street executive Frank
Lynch, former Reagan official Richard V. Allen, Bishop Rene Gracida
of Corpus Christi and Mary Ellen Bork, wife of unsuccessful Supreme
Court nominee Robert Bork.

In the Winter 1992 issue of _Campaign Update_ the organization's
quarterly newsletter, Rocco L. Martino, a Philadelphia business
executive wrote: "Separation of church and state is a false premise
that must finally be cast aside and replaced by the true meaning of
our constitution."

Oh yes, the organization's "national ecclesisatical advisor" is
Catholic politician Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York.

Well, yes, maybe I am. I'm trying to have people buy and take on my opinions,
thus causing said opinions to spread in time-honoured memetic virus mode until
the world is a veritable paradise. So how about it, folks? As they say over

Gong!

Take a moment and look at what you just wrote. First you defined
an "objective" morality and then you qualified this "objective" morality
with subjective justifications. Do you see the error in this?

Sorry, you have just disqualified yourself, but please play again.

You keep saying that. I do not think it means what you think it
means.
Perhaps you should explain what you think "science has it's basis
in values" means. The reason why people DO science is that
they value it's results. That does not mean that science has
it's basis in values. Any more than DES stops working if I stop
valuing my privacy.

Lets see what the dictionary has to say:

objective adj. 1. As having to do with a material object as distinguished
from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance. 3.a. Uninfluenced
by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on observable phenomenon.

(1)  Stephen said you took a quote out of context
(2)  You noted that Stephen had not replied to some other t.r.m article
     (call it A) that took a quote out of context
(3)  But the lack of evidence for X does not constitute evidence for the
     lack of X  (a common creationist error)
(4)  So the fact that Stephen did not reply to A does not justify the
     conclusion that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in A
(5)  You asked Stephen to explain why you were wrong and they were OK,
     or to acknowledge that he was being a hypocrite.  
(6)  Both of the choices you give Stephen assume that he condoned
     taking quotes out of context in A.
(7)  I assumed you were being logical, and that the sentence that begins
     "Could you please explain ..." was not a nonsequitur, but was intended
     to follow from the sentence that preceded it.
(8)  Therefore, I concluded that you believed that (2) implied that Stephen
     condoned taking quotes out of context in A
(9)  But we've already seen that (2) does not imply this
(10) Therefore, you were incorrect to believe that (2) implied that Stephen

True.  But forcing her to remain pregnant continues the violation of
her body for another 9 months.  I see this as being unbelievably cruel.

I'm curious about this statement, is it a known understanding amongst
Christian believers that people who don't understand the Christian
doctrines are enjoying this state? I come from a background with 
a heavy Christian teaching (Lutheran church), and consider myself
knowledgeable with the basic understandings of Christianity. At the 
same time I'm *not* proud of things I don't understand or know of at
this point of time. Ignorance is not bliss!

My online Bible is on a CD, but I don't own a CD-ROM system for the
time being, so I can't search for the famous cite where Jesus explicitly
states that he didn't want to break existing (Jewish) laws. In other
words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday
as their holy day, if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus.

This deserves framing.  It really does.  "[Atoms] aren't even real."

Tell me then, those atoms we have seen with electron microscopes are
atoms now, so what are they?  Figments of our imaginations?  The
evidence that atoms are real is overwhelming, but I won't bother with
most evidence at the moment.

Just to follow up on Casper's posting. I have been following this business
since it started 52 days ago.  The Branch Davidians have occupied the Mt.
Carmel location for some years, and their neighbors (you know, the people
next door) have said to a man, that the BD folks were quiet and never
bothered anybody.

There were some defector from the BD who alleged child abuse within the
movement, but how does this bring in the Feds? In particular what interest
would ATF have in child abuse. O.K. It was the allegation of possesing
illegal automatic weapons.  A search warrant could have been obtained
(properly) only on probable cause. This means that some evidence that an
illegal auto weapon was shipped in, or an illegal kit for converting
semi-auto weapons to full automatic was purchased or shipped.

In either case, how does this require an NO-KNOCK warrent, with a bunch of
macho hot dog assholes busting into the place *without* identifying
themselves. Milleniests tend to be a bit paranoid anyway. It is no
surprise they shot when invaded. Hell I am not a religious extremist and I
might have done the same myself. If the DEA busted into my house by
mistake without identifying themselve and I had a gun in my hand, I would
shoot first and wonder later.

So if it was illegal guns, the ATF should have gotten a normal warrant
(how can you flush a 50 calibre machine gun down the toilet?) and
presented it in a peaceful normal way. David Koresh has had brushes with
the law, even standing trial for attempted murder in which he was
acquitted. In every prior brush with the law, Koresh and his people acted
peacibly. There was no prior action on the part of the BD folks to
indicate that they were any danger to society.

NOTE: The question of whether the BD people were religious extremists or
slight daft is totally irrelevant. It is *not* against the law to be
looney or zany.

Look and learn folks. And be VERY afraid.

It may be "irrelevant" to you and *your* personal beliefs (or should I say

proclaim "truths" as a self-proclaimed appointee, may I ask you by what
authority you do this?  Because "it says so in the Bible?"  --Does the
Bible "say so," or is it YOU, or someone else, who interprets whether a
scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or "disapproval"?

Excuse moi, but your line of "truths" haven't moved me one bit to persuade
me that my beliefs are erroneous.  Of all the "preachers" of "truth" on
this net, you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking
crew, with no positive message to me or other latter-day saints whatsoever.
BTW, this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus
to the pharisees: "ye hypocrite(s) . . . ye preach about me with your lips,
but your hearts are far removed from me..."

Sophistry.  Look who's talking: "jumping to conclusions?"  You wouldn't do
that yourself, right?  All YOU address is your own convictions, regardless
whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points
of view, because you reject such interpretations without any consideration
whatsoever.

Correction: it may contradict would YOU think the Bible says.  The Bible
indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they
"belong to" or follow God in His footsteps.  Satan and his followers have
rebelled against God, and are not "children (=followers/redeemed) of God,"
but it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to
separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of
salvation.

So?  --This illustrates nicely what I just said: the children of the

(and have shown "works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the
wicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.  The issue

addressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible.  You

In this single posting of yours, I've seen more "constructs of imagination"
than in all of the pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news
group.  First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us
about "the only true God," whom you interpret according to your own likes
and dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about
Him myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other
faiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different
way or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission
and progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob
or opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited
every continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.

#  This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but

Sigh.  "What the Bible teaches"?  Or: "what the bible teaches according to
Robert Weiss and co.?"  I respect the former, I reject the latter without
the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by
the way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you
being a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a
Christian (following my own image of Him in my heart).

The issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-
represent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of "official doctrine"
is obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial
(e.g. "The Seven Deadly Heresies" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,
or erroneous at worst ("blacks not to receive the priesthood in this
dispensation").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable
contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal
interpretations (his book "Mormon Doctrine" is oftentimes referred to
as "McConkie's Bible" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather
look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!
(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie
was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of
God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted
doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and
speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most
biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the
trash coming from your proverbial pen.  I'm somewhat appalled that I have
allowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting...

The same way that any theory is proven false.  You examine the predicitions
that the theory makes, and try to observe them.  If you don't, or if you
observe things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen, then you have some 
evidence against the theory.  If the theory can't be modified to 
incorporate the new observations, then you say that it is false.

For example, people used to believe that the earth had been created
10,000 years ago.  But, as evidence showed that predictions from this 
theory were not true, it was abandoned.

Superficially a good answer, but it isn't that simple.  An awful lot of the
starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic
policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical
Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible
malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can
be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They
have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans
we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre
idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.

Perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against
Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children
are dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the
supposed "Pro-Life" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by
fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against
abortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more
of those by fighting for human rights in China.

And besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this
ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory
forced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.

Precisely.

There's no objective medicine; some people get marvellous results from
alternative therapy, others only respond to traditional medicine.

There's no objective physics; Einstein and Bohr have told us that.

There's no objective reality.  LSD should be sufficient to prove that.

I consider it to be a useful fiction; an abstract ideal we can strive
towards.  Like an ideal gas or a light inextensible string, it doesn't
actually exist; but we can talk about things as if they were like it, and not
be too far wrong.

Well, there are two approaches we can take here.  One is to ask you what this
objective morality is, assuming it's not a secret.

The other is to ask you what you think is wrong with relativism, so that we
can correct your misconceptions :-)

Actually, they generally claim that (b) their particular interpretation of
scripture/revelation *is* this objective morality.  That there are two
conflicting versions of this objective morality does tell us something about
(a).  It tells us at least one fake objective morality exists.

The next logical step is to deduce that any given religion's objective
morality could be the fake one.  So caveat emptor.

It may be "irrelevant" to you and *your* personal beliefs (or should I say

bottom line IS truth," independant from you or anyone else.  Since you
proclaim "truths" as a self-proclaimed appointee, may I ask you by what
authority you do this?  Because "it says so in the Bible?"  --Does the
Bible "say so," or is it YOU, or someone else, who interprets whether a
scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or "disapproval"?

Excuse moi, but your line of "truths" haven't moved me one bit to persuade
me that my beliefs are erroneous.  Of all the "preachers" of "truth" on
this net, you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking
crew, with no positive message to me or any other Latter-day Saint...
BTW, this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus
to the pharisees: "ye hypocrite(s) . . . ye preach about me with your lips,
but your hearts are far removed from me..."

Sophistry.  Look who's talking: "jumping to conclusions?"  You wouldn't do
that yourself, right?  All YOU address is your own convictions, regardless
whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points
of view, because you reject such interpretations without any consideration
whatsoever.

Correction: it may contradict would YOU think the Bible says.  The Bible
indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they
"belong to" or follow God in His footsteps.  Satan and his followers have
rebelled against God, and are not "children (=followers/redeemed) of God,"
but it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to
separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of
salvation.

So?  --This illustrates nicely what I just said: the children of the

(and have shown "works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the
wicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.  The issue

addressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible.  You
purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your "right" with non-

In this single posting of yours, I've seen more "constructs of imagination"
than in all of the pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news
group.  First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us
about "the only true God," whom you interpret according to your own likes
and dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about
Him myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other
faiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different
way or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission
and progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob
or opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited
every continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.

#  This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but

Sigh.  "What the Bible teaches"?  Or: "what the bible teaches according to
Robert Weiss and co.?"  I respect the former, I reject the latter without
the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by
the way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you
being a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a
Christian (following my own image of Him in my heart).

The issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-
represent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of "official doctrine"
is obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial
(e.g. "The Seven Deadly Heresies" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,
or erroneous at worst ("blacks not to receive the priesthood in this
dispensation").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable
contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal
interpretations (his book "Mormon Doctrine" is oftentimes referred to
as "McConkie's Bible" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather
look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!
(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie
was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of
God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted
doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and
speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most
biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the
trash coming from your proverbial pen.  I'm somewhat appalled that I have
allowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting...

Christian anti-Semitism comes from the obvious fact that the Jews should
know the Hebrew Scriptures better than anyone else, yet they did not
convert to Christianity en mass, thus rejecting "Christian Love."

I don't see why not. Where are the rest of the tribal people? What
happened to the tribes of the Americas? Culture is seen as different and
undesirable in the West, particular in the US with its failed "melting
pot concept." Most tribes have been hunted to extinction, the Hebrew
tribe is one of the few survivers from the Neolithic. Of course it
becomes difficult at times to separate Christianity from the Western
experience, so perhaps you are right, perhaps it would have been a better 
world if the cultural experiment in Christianity never happened.

Overlooking entirely that there is nothing to prevent anyone from

As it should be.  They have a homicide rate that is a couple of orders
of magnitude lower then this country's (as does almost everyone else
in the world).  But I suppose that it's too unreasonable to suppose
that a lower availability of handguns has anything to do with that fact.

Right.  Remember those riots a while back?  Remember what they were

When are we going to hear a Christian answer to this question? 

In paraphrase: 

On what or whose authority do Christians proclaim that they
are above the Law and above the Prophets (7 major and 12 minor) and not 
accountable to the Ten Commandments of which Jesus clearly spoke His opinion 
in Matthew 5:14-19? What is the source of this pseudo-doctrine? Who is
the pseudo-teacher? Who is the Great Deceiver?

Well, I am not Andy, but if you had familiarized yourself with some of
the current theories/hypotheses about abiogenesis before posting :-), you
would be aware of the fact that none of them claims that proteins were
assembled randomly from amino acids. It is current thinking that RNA-
based replicators came before proteinaceous enzymes, and that proteins
were assembled by some kind of primitive translation machinery.

Who said Christians want to conform to the teachings of Jesus?

"You are the light of the world. A city can't be hidden lying on a
mountaintop. Nor do people light a candle and cover it with a big
basket; they put it up on a tall candlestick where it can shine for
everyone in the house. That's how your light must shine in front of the
world, so that people see your good deeds and give credit to your Father
in the skies. Don't think I came to dissolve The Law [Torah aka First
Five Books] or The Prophets: [7 major plus 12 minor] I didn't come to
dissolve them, I came to fulfill them. I assure you, till the sky and
the earth go away, not one letter or punctuation mark of The Law will
ever go away until everthing has come to pass. So anyone who dissolves
even one of the smallest commandments and teaches others the same way,
will be known as the lowest in the kingdom of the skies; whereas anyone
who keeps the commands and teaches them too, will be known as someone
great in the kingdom of the skies."  Matt5:14-19, Gaus, ISBN:0-933999-99-2

	I recently read an article in a local paper written by an Islamic
  person who was upset with the way Islam has been portrayed by western media.
  When a terrorist action takes place in the middle east, it is always played
  up as an Islamic Terrorist.  However, when the a Serbian terrorist attacks
  the Croations, its not a Christian terrorist, its just a terrorist.
	I have often tried to explain this to some close friends who believe
  the press, that Islam is somehow tied to violence.  Often times you hear
  things like "They just don't value human life like we do..." and so on.
  I was wondering if anyone out there had any suggestions for how we can

Hmmm, give everyone a gun, free.  What a thought.  Let's see where it would

have guns, they don't like me shooting your, they shoot me.  My friends have

Funding abortion for those women who can't afford it would save the
government money, not cost it.  The cost of delivery is much higher,
and those women can't afford that either.  Funding guns, as you suggest
as an "analogy" would *cost* the government money and would lead to
effective anarchy.  See the difference?  Somehow I doubt you can.

The observation that the Tree of Life would rotate clockwise in the
northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern probably doesn't
give enough consideration to the feebleness of the Coriolis force compared
to, say, the phototropism of vegetation.  A much more likely explanation
is the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because
the sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the
historical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation
images of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of
the clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course
not.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the
anti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or
because it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun
to represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,
but I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.

The trouble with trying to find out the truth is that Roehm and his
buddies were ACCUSED OF being flaming faggots, one of the pretexts for the
Night of Long Knives in which Roehm and most of the SA wing of the NSDAP
were purged.  Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,
anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered
tainted evidence.  The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,
the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better
place when they departed, but concrete particulars are still no more than
more or less shrewd guesses.

Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. [Honestly.]
The word of Sin is Restriction. [Would I kid you?]


Does one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands
of individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the
Order.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much
differently than had one applied them within the confines of
their original expression.

I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior 
of the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit
from Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes
to which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.
I have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely
he was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order 
for many years.

Yet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back
so carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is
only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed
which extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there
was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order
itself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.


Let us examine this issue a bit more closely....

"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist
and paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo
Templi Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he
met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  
Kellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz
Hartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together
prior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902
in Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death,
Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of
the 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught
secret of sexual magic.
 
"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in
Augsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and
possibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist
League founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was
later associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden
Dawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to
found the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several
attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the
development of the O.T.O.

"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership.
For example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin
and H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between
Reuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and
accused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,
the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for
the first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all
the English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked
when publishing the material of the Equinox.

"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a
stroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when
_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break
in the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.
over the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.
He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply
infusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation."

_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'

Within _Equinox III:10_, Edited by 
  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,
    Caliph of the United States of America,
      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.



There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this
material in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?
Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own
organization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle
of Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very
complex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room
for very many interpretations.

It is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived
out of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters
with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I
can take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble
support of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.

Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  
Will I?  
I think not.
Why?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection
I am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things
in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be
quite difficult to apprehend at first.

So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.
I do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess
them, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of
the Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then
what can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that
the Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or
does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of
universal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic
requirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?


I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.
They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane
or usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  
Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or
were very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity
of the organization as it stands.

I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments 
I followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting
a Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating
in social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic
Mass well enough for my tastes.
 

This doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.
I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my
limited contact with other members.

I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many
ways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with
the Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom
and the preservation of individual vision.

I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response
to other posts in this thread.

Not entirely.  Its not a premise, its a conclusion.  Second, that scientists
(for the most part) exlude the possibility is not a problem, its a necessity. 
Scientists are empircists, not theologians.

So do scientists, and long before you did.  Clearly you have a deep and

Absolutely and utterly false (except for some were AMHs). Lucy (Australopithecus
afarensis, ca. 3 to 3.25 mya) is 40% complete, and about 80% taking into 
consideration bilateral symmetry.  Lucy walked upright and bipedally, just 
like humans, and the two share a remarkably similar dental pattern.  Her
cranial morphology is unlike humans or modern apes.  There are hundreds of 
other specimens of this and other species, of which only some are *partially* 
reconstructed.  They exist Bill.  You can touch them, feel them, hold them.  
But forget hominids.  The earth, the universe, the cultural record all look and 
test out as ancient indeed.  They are not reconstructions.  Has God has tricked
us here too?  It won't go away, Bill.

That was not your point, Bill.  Your point above was God *has* the power ....
Scientists generally agree with that.  That's a far cry from saying God did.

KS, I see you're wanting Malcolm's response. Allow me one last inter-
jection then please:

Distinguishing among the religious Jews, you've excepted the Messianic
for obvious reasons. Specifically, are you saying it's these religious 
Jews, who trace their lineage back to Abraham by blood and orthodoxy, 
rather than by faith, who won't agree?  Orthodox Jews?  

As to the a/a (if I understand your direction), the issue remains 
unproven I suspect, considering how atheists and agnostics so often 
look to reason. Atheist, it is reasonable to conclude will not agree.
For agnostics, a poll seems in order. Who knows?  Myself, I'm not so 
sure the atheists can be counted out. 

For the orthodox, I wonder how many would follow Moses, or Abraham,
or David in accepting God's Word? Is the particular covenant to which
one adheres, more important than God promisimg? I reckon for many it
depends on the ongoing dialogue. Under these considerations, you might 
understand why I think it's premature to assert who will and won't agree.

Definitely, J.R. "Bob" Dobbs, numero uno, top dog, not one can touch, not

But close El Segundo (el subliminal) is the infamous Paul (birthname Saul) the
Evangeline who became famous as a result of his numerous trampoline act 
tours of the eastern Mediterranean.

Jesus on the other hand was duped, a pawn of the Con, fell pray to the
Holywood Paradox (ain't nothing but a sign in the hills!). Like many
Afro-Asians, Jesus found the earth all too pink! And to think that after
his death, the Con changed him into a tall blond Holywood sun god! And I

Bill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the
Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean
an expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the
chips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be
defined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are
not trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).

Why an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly
out of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere 
in his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which 
it lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.

Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about
the Josephus insert, your "proof" is meaningless and it should not be repeated
here.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would "prove"
nothing.  Scholars speak of the "weight of evidence."  Far more independent
evidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your
belief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass
faith off as fact.

As for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring
inconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect? 
Shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel 
Fictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for 
Herb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share 
an evolutionary ancestry).

The fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny
your position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels "prove" your faith. 
Independent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already
discussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. 
Moreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted
to "prove" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than
saying "I am right because I say so."  

Your logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian 
General Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where
"fundamentalist" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)
Jesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily
resurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the
clincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe
"inerrant" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the
first four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant
bible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to 
contain the first four.  

Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!

Its faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else. 
Whatever works for you.  Just don't foist it on others.

If no-one looks at the results, or acknowledges their correctness, in what
meaningful sense can the chip be said to "work"?? Does flibozity exist?
By "flibozity", I mean a particular, extremely complex configuration of 
physical phenomena, which no-one, absolutely NO-ONE cares about in the 
slightest. Does it exist, Eric?

Getting back to the question of whether the DES chip "works", doesn't "work" 
mean something like "achieving the desired/expected effect"? Note the way 
intentionality subtly underlies that definition. Even if we take the 
definition as "expected", instead of "desired", can you deny that conformance 
to expectations is itself a value of sorts, namely the scientific values of 
accuracy-of-prediction and reproducibility-of-results?

The phenomenologist Husserl, for one, considered Intentionality to be the
primary ontological "stuff" from which all other ontology was built --
perceptions, consciousness, thoughts, etc. Frank is by no means alone in
seeing intentionality (or "values", as he puts it) underlying all human
experience, even the so-called "objective" experiences, such as 
measurements of the natural world, or the output of your DES chip.

You're admitting a lot more than that.  You are admitting that
your morals are situational.   You are admitting that the actions
of other people and the situation you are in help to determine
how you judge the moral significance of one of your own actions.

If you employ X degree of force, that's not moral, but if you employ
X degree of force, but previously someone else has employed Y degree
of force, and the situation is thus-and-so, that *is* moral.

This is quite different from saying "Employing force on other people
is immoral, period.   Unfortunately, from time to time we are obliged
to do this immoral thing for reasons of self-preservation, and so
we have to bear the moral consequences of that.

For what it's worth - and yes, I know you claim to be an agnostic -
it's this ability to re-label things from "immoral" to "moral" 
that I find one of the *least* attractive qualities of the religious
mind.

So it was a complete non-sequitur, is that it?     How does coming
up with a derisory deal tell us anything about the existence of
"objective" values.

You're asking us to accept that the deal you offered would be turned
down, and we believe that, not because we appeal to objective values
but becasue we know, or think we know, something about people.

All the people we know exhibit *subjective* values that would lead
them to reject a deal of $1 for all of the land in America.

Great.   Now, so what?

Very easily. Show them pictures of crime scenes perpetrated by Christian
terrorists in this country, if that doesn't convince them have them talk
to the victims of Christian terrorism. 

A brutal act of terrorism inspired by Christian propoganda was recently
commited on your very campus. 

Its very simple religious extremists of all religions put no value on
human life. Christian and Islamic fundamentalists put advancing there
religion above all else, even if doing so violates the religion itself.

P.S. I'm not saying all Christians are terrorists, I'm using "Christian
     terrorist" in the same way the media uses Islamic terrorist.

Kent: With all due respect, how can I take you seriously, when you have
the NAMES wrong in the 1st place? E.g.:

>
>The San Jose RC (Ordo Rosae Crucis) 

	There is no such thing. The correct name is Ancient & Mystical
Order Rosae Crucis, abbreviated AMORC.

>...and the Rocicrusian
>order created by Max Heindel.

	There is no such thing either. It's the Rosicrucian Fellowship.
And they clearly state that they DO NOT pretend to descend from the
Order of the Fama Fraternitatis.

>In addition there are many splinter groups
>all around Europe that all claim some connection with the original

The Lectorium? And who else?

>Some Freemason groups
>also have Rosicrucian-like separate groups, even if they are far
>from the ideologies the RC groups have somehow in common.

These are NOT Rosicrucian "orders". They are Masonic study groups, none
of which *claims* to be descendant of the original Order.

What is ORC? If you mean AMORC, you didn't even learn the correct
name?!

Well, there is a fair amount of evidence floating around that indicates
that OTO has been around since at least the late 1800s, long before
Crowley ever heard of it, how long has AMORC been around? (yes, I know
that they claim to have existed as an organization clear into prehistory,
but I doubt that they have any organizational paperwork
as a non-profit that can be carbon-dated to 20,000 BC)

Absolutely. Lewis didn't care for the 1921 O.T.O. charter from Reuss. He had
in mind something completely diferent. Crowley and Lewis were very
different persons, as you probably know.

ON the subject of how many competing RC orders there are, let me point out the
Golden Dawn is only the *outer* order of that tradition.  The inner order is
the Roseae Rubeae et Aurae Crucis.  That's Ruby Rose and Gold Cross, in rough
translation.  The G.'.D.'. is a Rosicrucian order, as are all derivative
groups.  Of course, real Rosicrucians never admit to being Rosicrucian.

Enjoy the journey!

There are "basic services" and there are "optional services", Dennis. Call 
waiting is an optional service, but having the number "3" work on one's phone
is a basic service. Just because some nutcase doesn't happen to use the "3"
on his phone, since none of the numbers he calls has a "3" in it, doesn't mean 
that he has the right to demand that the phone company "unbundle" the charges
for the use of each phone digit; an unbundling that would be horrendously
inefficient because of all the billing & bookkeeping overhead. Similarly, 
abortion can be seen as a "basic service".

Furthermore, public funding of abortion SAVES money, as well as being, in the 
views of a substantial portion of the population, probably a clear majority, 
an ethical thing to do. If you don't like saving money on your taxes in that 
way, why don't you take the taxes you save and invest in private charities 
with programs that help reduce the NEED for abortion. If every pro-lifer did 
the same, it would create a massive economic negative feedback loop which 
would all but ELIMINATE the need for public funding of abortion. Then you 
would get your wish. And, you know what? No pro-choicer I know would stop
you carrying out that plan. They might even HELP you with it...

	Just wondering, do you mean the "Lectorium Rosicrucianum"?
Warning: There is no point in arguing who's "legit" and who's not. *WHICH*
Golden Dawn are you talking about?

	Just for the sake of argument, (reflecting NO affiliation)
I am going to say that the TRUE Rosicrucian Order is the Fraternitas
Rosae Crucis in Quakertown, Penn.,

	Any takers? :-)

The following is an introduction as to who is Muhammad SAW
as will be covered with this treatise.

MUHAMMAD peace and blessings of Allah be upon him (SAW)
is the last prophet of Islam.  He is the Prophet who is revealed
the last Holy Scripture, Qur'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him)
through the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets
till the day of judgement as stated in the Qur'an by Allah
SWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between
571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW,
is a treason against Islam, against Qur'an, against the message
of Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another
messenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.
He is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his
coming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur'an is from 
Chapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:

	Muhammad is not the father of any of your men,
	but (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal
	of the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of
	all things.

---------------------
Commentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,
it is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The 
Holy Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.
Allah's teaching is and will always be continuous, but there
has been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later
ages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not
an arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom,
"for Allah has full knowledge of all things."

   		 NINETEENTH LETTER  

		 MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI 
(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)       

(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)

   SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW)
declared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a
decree as the Glorious Qur'an and manifest miracles
which number, according to the scholars, one thousand.
The occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as
certain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In
fact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate
unbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise
Our'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His
miracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) 
sorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their
followers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the
certainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars
of Islam) to the hundreth degree.
   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of
the universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the
effect of the words,'You have indeed spoken the truth !'
   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,
while being observed by Him, 'The true ruler has
appointed me to such and such position.  'At a time when
you were asked to prove your claim, the word 'Yes'
uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if
the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your
request, this would confirm your claim even more soundly
and more definitely than would the word 'Yes.'
   In the same way, ALLAH's Most Noble Messenger
claimed: 'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this
universe.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken
order at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my
fingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five
spigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He
splits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear
witness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at
this food: although it is barely enough for two or three
men, it satisfies two or three hundred.  'Further he shows
hundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of
the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his
prophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his
deeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral
conduct and manners, his character and appearance
prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.
Indeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the
famous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief
merely by seeing him, and said, 'No lie can hide in this
face, nor can any fraud be found in it!'
   Although many of the  researchers have concluded
that the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his
miracles number about one thousand, there are
thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of
his prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of
truth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions
have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of
ways.
   The Wise Our'an alone demonstrates thousands of
the proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty
aspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a
phenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of
individuals who claimed prophethood and performed
miracles have lived and passed away; then, the
prophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity
superior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For
whatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the
means of the prophethood and messengership of all the
messengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they
are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive
fashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and
means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the
person of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found
in him with more certanity than all the other prophets.

I think this is a weak argument.  The fact is, there are *two* references to
Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least
been altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that
Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage
says the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the
Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho
for Jesus and may be authentic.
   There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference
to Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which
lack the references.

It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but
I don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in
the scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes
this position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view
that Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of
biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to
the historicity of Jesus.)

The first means that some aspect of reality contains objective values.
The second means that values are a reference to some preference of the
individual.  In the first case, it is possible that some future discovery
might invalidate certain views re what objective values are.

Stop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that 
the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi 
party, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red
herring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of 
the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using 
homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that
Hitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse
official history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts
right. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in
a coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of
homosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it
is possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt
it - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his
former right hand man was a homosexual?). 

Anyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references 
to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the 
night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even 
the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, 
this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the 
1920's.

>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,

>tainted evidence. 

Ah, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the
paranoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with 
homosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know 
what tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made 
by persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those 
accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the 
1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in 
time and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers 
which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being 
obvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter
do you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in 
these matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a 
false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point 
here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof 
falls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework 
before making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.

>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,

>place when they departed, 

This is just about the *only* thing we agree on. 

I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and 
his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling
seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this
must be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what
lies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this
is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If 
you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them 
and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from 
their footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and
tracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my
specialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would
cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my time
trying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.

>but concrete particulars are still no more than

>-- Diccon Frankborn

Given that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would
constitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been
considered "shrewd guesses"?

I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -
historians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious 
footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually 
provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place 
to start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.

I'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My
apologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent. I forget which gods

I think the passage you're looking for is the following.

Matthew 5:17    "Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the 
prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. 
Matthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, 
not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. 
Matthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments 
and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he 
who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of 
heaven. 
Matthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of 
the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 

There are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the
Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but
not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human
beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The
issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do
about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to
impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It
simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  This
is a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.
(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded
in Acts 15.)

However there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the
role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent
rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of
the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a
purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this
issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his
discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and
assures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees
the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their
sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that
has been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world's
clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the
interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does
not entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an
uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.
For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be
relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we
live in faith, not Law.

While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the
end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The
quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest
of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the
Law.  The "not an iota or dot" would suggest a rather literal reading,
but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations
emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial
details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude
towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat
5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish
discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a
tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that
really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and
plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who
use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and
the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific
view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the
Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.
Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being
superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the
"ceremonial law", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite
concerned about maintaining moral standards.

The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being
superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe
they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is
embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters
responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the
Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish
ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards
of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems
to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and
human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later
to give Paul so much trouble.

It's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but
we should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the
way terms like "family values" take on special meaning from the
current context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to
figure out why "family values" should be used as a code word for
opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I
think Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was
involved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values
that go along with the term "Law", any more than people who concerned
about the "family values" movement are really opposed to family
values.

They don't work because you need a nation-wide confiscation of all guns,
Ralphie. That's why it dosen't work in D.C. They didn't confiscate the guns
that all ready exist. Therefore what Ray said still applies.

However Ralphie, the amount of killings would go down. Think about it. With
guns it just takes the pull of a trigger. Other forms of murder require much
more effort on the part of the murderer.

You should! Although maybe you're right. Well armed citizens wouldn't have
to worry about little boys and their threats against women and abortion
clinics.

Ralphie, ever been to London or any major city in the UK? You know not what

your lines about civil wars and society erupting in the U.S.

Ralphie, only you in your sick mind would think that this is the reason Japan
and Germany's GNP are two of the highest. Probably had more to do with the
economic re-building after World War II. I think you need to study the issue
a little more. But in Ralphie's World, violence is to be worshipped. Isn't it
Ralphie (or whichever of your multiple personalities wrote this post)?

Komrade EMIL,

How many times need we point the obvious OUT to you.
As LONG as the Patriarchy has been Decimated by 
ModernSeXularHumanism and ITS imposition that only
the STATE is authorized to Wield Capital Punishment,
We can NEVER restore WholeSomeGodFearingBibleBelievingTraditionalFamilyValues!

Now Just Imagine Father Abraham in the Modern Era?

God Comes unto him and demands that he take his son up
to the Hills to be sacrificed unto the Lord.

Now Abraham being a devout man leads out his son for a 
sacrifice to God On High, and BANG!!!! Out Comes the BATF
with Tanks and Air Support to cover the Child Protection Agency
with a Warrent for Abraham's arrest as a Moral Deviant and a 
Child Abuser!!!! The BATF Lays SIEGE to Father Abraham's home
for months on END and will NOT LISTEN to the VOICE of GOD!!!!

As LONG as ModernSeXularHumanism is allowed to DENY the
God Given Rights of the Patriarchy we CAN NOT be SAFE!!!!!

I see the point on falsifying God as per the scientific method.  A question
I've always wanted to ask is this: When scientists say that the second law
does not apply to the earth they say it is because it is not a closed system, 
i.e. there is energy coming in from an outside force -- namely, the sun.  Is 
the universe a closed or open system, and how could either be proven? If it is
a closed system, have you been to the outside to look in?  If it is open, how 
do you know?

I'll yield the discussion on absolute morality until I can think of another way
to discuss it.  If you're interested in a change, here's an idea.

If morals come from what is societally accepted, why follow that? What right do
we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality?
Pardon the extremism, but couldn't I murder your "brother" and say that I was 
exercising my rights as I saw them, was doing what felt good, didn't want
anyone forcing their morality on me, or I don't follow your "morality" ?

    Non-toxic tear gas?!?  Do you know what tear gas is?

    I do: once upon a time I happened to be in a room when someone threw 
    a tear-gas grenade in (that was supposed to be a joke:).  The sensation 
    was incredible: I felt my eyes and nostrils were being torn apart.
    I remember us - a bunch of young men in our early 20's - running out
    like a herd of wild animals, knocking down the door and jumping
    out of the windows (thank G-d we were on the first floor).

    I can't imagine this kind of stuff being used against children.

I don't necessarily agree with Pat Robertson.  Every one will be placed before
the judgement seat eventually and judged on what we have done or failed to do
on this earth.  God allows people to choose who and what they want to worship.
Worship of money is one of the greatest religions in this country.

I do agree that it was a terrible tragedy and, yes, the FBI blew it.

Cult status, maybe, but they didn't have to take up arms to protect themselves.
As you may recall, the early Christians were pacifists preferring to avoid
physical confrontation rather than dealing with it in like manner.  Why else
do you think the apostles were thrown into jail so often and beaten up for the
sake of their beliefs?

Self-fulfilled.  I heard that Koresh was predicting that the FBI would be the
ones to burn.  It doesn't take any great insight to light yourself on fire, maybe
perverse delusion.

NOT!  He was an egomaniac who had the attention of the entire world for a brief
moment in time.  Rather than live with the shame of being taken captive by the
FBI, Koresh chose to kill himself and his followers.  Sick and . . . sad.

  I don't think it's too far off of the mark, either.  No one 'deserves' what
they get.  Punishment is for the justice system (flawed as it may be).  This
whole 'well it served the idiots right' mentality is nothing but a revenge
mentality, and my opinion is that "revenge is for children and the emotionally
retarded" (Frank Herbert, 'Dune' series).

  Well... every group has a somewhat selective memory of it's past.  Even the
protestants who look to Martin Luther for starting the whole movement
conveniently forget his diatribes telling nobles to slaughter the peasants
who rebelled against unjust conditions.

  They stood up for what they believed in, and the people of the time hated
them for that, and because they were different.  Xenophobia has always been
one of the strongest reasons for death and destruction.

  Anyone who's confident in what they believe should not have a problem
listening to dissenting points of view...  It's something called 'free speech',
which radicals usually push aside in favour of doing what's 'right'.

 Ahh... I agree with that most strongly.  Who cares about 'claims'??  All I
want to see are actions.  If you act like you hate me, you probably do, all
pie-in-the-sky religious affiliations to the contrary.

  Yes!  Most people don't realize that it's NOT some 'government' sitting
in a far-away magical land that makes decisions, it's people.  And those
people make mistakes like any human.  Questioning the government in everything
it says and does should be one of our most fundamental rights.

  Until this all settles, I'm not sure anyone can make that sort of blanket
statement.  Sure, they may have been quiet peace-loving people who just
happened to be armed to the teeth, but who knows what David Koresh had planned?

  You don't even have to break laws to get punished, as I'm sure many people
have found out.  What about the drug laws that permit the police to seize
any suspect goods?  And some grandmother travels with $30,000 in cash in her
handbag, (doesn't trust the banks), it falls open, and the police end up
confiscating it?  This is not an isolated case, either.

  Or laws to stop companies from making look-alike Ford/GM car parts, and
selling them as the real thing?  The first people that got raided were antique
companies who made 'real GM' parts for 1930's cars.

  All I'm saying is that it should NOT be assumed that someone is inherently
evil/etc when the government decides to nail them.

  It's the people who blindy believe that the government does the best in
everything for them who are _really_ dangerous.

In addition, it is ridiculous for this Hicks guy from the FBI saying that
they were just trying to bring them before the bar to face justice, when
who should really be on trial is every officer involved in the brainless
BATF assault.  Granted, it would be tough to convict when the bodies were
inside, but if you're going to talk about justice then you have to consider
the gross incompetence and disregard for human life displayed by the ATF.
Charge 'em and try 'em!

It is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by
"average" people, and that at the time, almost all Americans were pretty
homogeonously Christian.  It was largely the mainstream Christian's disgust
at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred.

The situation is not entirely different today.  Many irrational feelings and
beliefs are justified through religion.  I don't think most of them are started
because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and perpetuate
prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification which discourages
critical thought.

Do you mean that the "secular authorities" are some continuous group of
people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the
Mormons?  Do you honestly believe that the main reason for using Utah for
nuclear testing etc.. was to "get them thar Mormons"?  And what about the
majority of Uthan's who aren't Mormons?  You seem to be searching for enemy
conspiracies.  It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you badly
must have been done primarily for that purpose.

I personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to the
life of even one person.  Sure, he did not pose a threat to the security of
this nation.  But he did pose a threat to the lives of his followers.  That
much is definite.

This is like asking who REALLY caused the deaths of the Israeli Olympic
team in 1976?  In that case, the police botched the job as well.  But to
lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorists would be a terrible mistake.
I think the same sort of reasoning applies in this case.  Certainly, if David
Koresh chose any peaceful option, the ATF and FBI would have complied.  The
responsibility is more his than the authorities.

>David Koresh, no doubt, will be described as the "evil" guy (by the

Characterizing the ATF/FBI as executioners is inaccurate and unfair.  In order
to be an executioner, the least one must have done is have the intent to kill.

The mother church of Jerusalem disappeared when the Romans took the city.
Despite some pious legends, the evidence seems to be that the members of
the church died fighting the Romans during what they believed to be the
last days. We know that certain Apostles had nicknames connecting them to
Jewish terrorist groups. For the average inhabitant of the Roman Empire
(especially after centuries of political instability and terror), the
Roman policies in Palestine were heartily approved of. When studied with a
knowledge of cult psychology, Acts is eerily familiar, especially today.

Yes, this is certainly one of the traditional ideas about the Mithraic
cult (although not the only one.)  It had many elements that seem
to have been borrowed by Catholicism (e.g. the Mass, communion, the
sharing of a sacred meal, consecration of bread and wine, etc.)

For quite an amusing novel that uses this same idea, check out:

The Covenant of the Flame
by David Morrell.

It has some quite interesting occult bits, and lots of killing.
I won't spoil it by revealing the ending, but I will say that it
is relevant to Mithraism.

True enough.  O.K., in the universe we have today, which is better, a science

which predicts that sonic the hedgehog will record an album with Elvis on

	Hmmm...let's see here - the drugs in question are illegal,
kids shooting kids (actually people shooting people) is illegal, 
sex with children is illegal, child abuse is illegal, etcetera etcetera.
Yep, it sure looks like the legislation of your morality is working like

Tony-

I read your post, it was nothing new, I had seen much the same in other
typical"Christian" anti-gay sentimental literature.  Gay people are and will
con- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may
be unaware of all the statistica "findings" concerning African-Americans that
have been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias
against African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,
but there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public
scoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.
Fortunately African-Americans had "whites" who supported their 'cause' and
public sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was
even a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws
were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty
much legal to discriminate against them.

I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free
form discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,
that is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)
openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,
including gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation
and making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love,
and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular
to do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a
church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes
in the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actually
sho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially
within their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian
community for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists
against the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and
treated as runaway slaves for being "nigger-lovers" and such.  I guess I've
decided the challenge is worth it.

In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic
story centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight
who have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of one
case where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject
their gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they
began to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.

I'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0
raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values
Coalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner
support within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more
oppressive legisation against gays.

Perhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in the
Middle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands
in witch hunts and inquisitions.

The message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay
rights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even
hatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change
the results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the
final effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a
"conditional" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This is
sure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an "unconditional"
love, one that calls people "just as they are."  Sure there are things that
will 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that
need to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things
like left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is
going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to "other
people's expectations." In the process this coerced conformity causes many
people a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have
nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their
own sense of pseuper-spirituality.

This is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be
unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with
something very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but I
firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation
on thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfully
removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,
but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it
helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.
Gay people are not criminals.

Another interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic
church in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self-
admitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently
been going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were
voluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that
was how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing
happen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends
recently told me he was "approached" by someone who is going through the
reparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for
dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.

These are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and
creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not
the call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in
Colorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over
Colorado called "S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T." (I forget the whole definition off hand,
but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto
is "Working for a fag-free America" with an implicit advocation for violence.

This is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are
embracing.

We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression
towards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from
organizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good
purpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of
excluding people.

The Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to "include"
people.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful,
especially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto
itself.  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people
to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?

Whatever

Rich :-(

It is always cheaper to kill children than to take responsibility for
them.  Why stop at birth, why not fund infanticide up to age 2?

I think you lose the right to talk about THE truth once you say values are
relative.   Accuracy is a value judgement, too.  It so happens I agree with 
the substance of what you say below, but it's clear to me that at least 
*some* values are objective.  Truth is better than falsehood, peace is
better than war, education is better than ignorance.  We know these things,
if we know anything.

#Assuming, for the moment, that morals _are_ relative, then two
#relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute
#truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that
#produces the desired results.

No they cannot, because they acknowledge up front that THE desired
results do not exist.  That, after all, is the meaning of compromise.

Plus some problems: If the relativists have no values in common, compromise 
is impossible - what happens then?    Who, if anyone, is right?  What happens 
if one relativist has a value "Never compromise?".  A value "plant bombs in 
crowded shopping areas"?  After all, if morals are relative, these values 
cannot *meaningfully* be said to be incorrect.

#Assuming that there is an absolute morality, two disagreeing 
#objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right; there
#is no room for compromise.  Once you beleive in absolute morals,

#with you is amoral.

Untrue.  One can accept that one does not know the whole truth.  Part
of the objective truth about morality may well be that flexibility is
better than rigidity, compromise is better than believing you have a lock
on morals, etc.  In the same way, I can believe in an objective reality
without claiming to know the mechanism for quantum collapse, or who shot
JFK.

#Given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention,
#I'd say that compromise seems to be "better".

And I would agree.   But it's bloody to pointless to speak of it if it's
merely a matter of taste.  Is your liking for peace any better founded
than someone else's liking for ice-cream?  I'm looking for a way to say
"yes" to that question, and relativism isn't it.

If there is no objective value, nothing can be objectively valued.  "useful"
is a value judgement, and "science" is something which can be valued.  It

#I think that you are changing the meaning of "values" here. Perhaps
#it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.
#
#value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods
#or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in 
#usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality
#considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as
#of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus. 
#The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or
#lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech
#sound. 
#
#In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms
#of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that
#these definitions do not mean the same thing.

No, I'm using definition (3), or perhaps (4) in both cases.  If there
is no objective worth, usefulness, or importance then science has no 
objective worth, usefulness, or importance.  If nothing is inherently
worthwhile or desirable, then simple theories with accurate predictions
are not inherently worthwhile or desirable. Do you see any flaws in this?

If on the other hand, some things *have* objective worth, usefulness,
or importance, it would be interesting to know what they are.

#If you can provide an objective foundation for "morality" then that will
#be a good beginning.

I'm not willing to attempt this until someone provides an objective
basis for the notion that science is useful, worthy, or important in
dealing with observed facts.  Alternatively, you could try to
demonstrate to me that science is not necessarily useful, worthy
or important in any situation.   In other words, I need to know
how you use the term "objective".

Yes it would.  Luckily these parameters are fixed by reality.  If I can
predict with almost 100% accuracy that Americans prefer to own their portions of
the US than an infinitesmal portion of $1, in what sense are these values
not objective?  I don't think I'm way off beam in saying that "something is
better than nothing" is a rational and objective valuation. Do you agree
with me then that the assertion "no values are objective" is false?

I'm afraid it's much worse than this! Jesus said follow the Ten
Commandments AND the Torah And the Prophets. Christians on the other
hand are not only above the Ten Commandments AND the Torah AND the
Prophets, i.e. they believe that they do not have to follow it, they
don't even follow the subjective morality of Jesus! So, we see that
Christians can't follow the "objective morality" of their own Ten
Commandments, they can't follow the "subjective morality" of Jesus when
He said follow the Ten Commandments, yet they expect the rest of the
world to do; what? Is there any logic here? Is there any morality here,
objective or subjective? Is Christianity somebody's idea of a joke? Who
could be pulling the wool over the eyes of so many Christians? Who could
be such a great deceiver?

	Yes:

	If one's particular goal is to land a man on the moon, or to 
put a communication sattelite into a orbit within which it will operate; 
then orbital astronomy will be more important.

	However, if one is a particular fan Sonic's singing, or a competator 
of Sonic, say Mario and the Toadstools; knowing when he will record an ablum 
would be more important.

	I fail to see how this is connected in any way, nor where you are 
driving too.

	So, if you were housing a Jew in your home in Holand, 1942; and
the SS troopers asks if you are housing a Jew, is it objectively better to
tell the truth, " I am holding a Jew ", than a falsehood, " No I am not
holding a Jew"?

	In this case, let us assume that if you lie, the SS trooper leaves,
never to bother you. Either way, nothing is ever done to you- no prison, 
trouble, etc.

	Of course, if you tell the truth, then the Jew will be executed.

	Is it better to tell the truth, or lie?
	




	[ In this case, I would consider not saying anything to be a lie.
Or, at the very least, it implies that falsehood is on the same level of 
telling the truth. Or, we can stipulate that the SS have methods to make you 
say something: only they can not control whether or not you say "yes" or
"no". Only that you will say one or the other. ]

It's partly as you say: the reason why people do science is that they value it's
results.  If one follows relativism to the letter, then, the theories
and predictions which are the results of science can only be subjectively
valued as 'objective', 'correct', or anything else.  One cannot attach
any objective worth to the results of science,  for the simple reason
that one cannot attach objective worth to anything.  

However, not only are the outputs of science subjectively valued, so are
the inputs.  More problems.  Which facts to observe?   What
is a fact?  When am I justified in valuing sensory input as signal rather
than noise?  How do I know that everyone makes the call the same as I
do?  As a loyal relativist, I must assume that what's signal for me
may not be signal for you.  The objectivity postulate should not sit
well with me.

So the relativist attends to a system, designed at whim, fed with what should 
be assumed to be conflicting data, in the expectation of results which need 
satisfy no-one.  GIGO.

What do you mean when you say "I would have no objection?"

Do you mean it's moral to use force on someone who advocates
the use of force?

Or do you mean that sometimes we have to use force on such
people out of necessity or self-defence, while recognizing
that our own actions in doing so are not moral?

Overriding any concern about morality is the fact that men (Dennis
is a man's name?) don't get abortions.  Thus it is unreasonable to 
suppose that YOUR insurance premiums are being used for the 
possibility that you will be getting an abortion.

It looks like what you're really objecting to is other people paying
money for the possibility that THEY might need to get an abortion.

Well you know that you're getting somewhere, when you start getting
responses like this.

Kent, let me explain it to you.

If you are paying for a phone, and you don't want call-waiting, YOU DON'T
NEED TO PAY FOR CALl-WAITING.

This whole Clinton induced abortion debate SHOULD begin to make NARAL
nervous, because it has exposed a real scam.

If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT
"abortion coverage" there is NO reason for that person to be COMPLELLED
to pay for it.  (Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction
coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage).

A full third of the country flatly considers abortion to be murder
for reasons of conscience.  If the first amendment means ANYTHING at all
anymore, then these people should NOT be COMPELLED to PAY for "abortion
coverage" if it is so OBVIOUSLY offensive to their beliefs.  Or are we
going to start forcing Jews to eat pork, Quakers to fight in wars, etc?

No one should be COMPELLED to sign a defacto "loyalty oath" in support of
abortion in order to gain access to health care, ESPECIALLY if one's
conscience is so obviously against the practice (of abortion).

IF it were'nt for the sin of men, none of this killing would have been 
necesarry, He is KIND and LOVING, but also RIGHTEOUS, 
SIN MUST BE PUNISHED.

Before Jesus, man had to take the sins on himself.
But Jesus died and took it all upon Him, so now we also have a FORGIVING GOD.

If He were not KIND and LOVING, there wouldn't have been any people left.

I live in Colorado, and have never heard of such a group.  Obviously claims

Hardly.  Saying that homosexuality is a sin is a far cry from 
"Working for a fag-free America".  Saying that I wouldn't want 
a homosexual babysitting for my kids doesnt mean I endorse 
"Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash".

And now we have homosexual advocates telling us that if we don't teach 
our kids that homosexuality is natural and a perfectly acceptable 
alternative lifestyle, then they will have it done for us.  No, thanks.

Absolutely.  And the message is always, "go and sin no more".  Not, 
Go and do whatever "feels good". 

One question, at the start of your post, you wrote:

This sounds real nice, but struck me as a little odd.  You're 
presenting yourself as if you were a straight Xian, who is sticking
his neck out and taking on the challenge of speaking out in support 
of gays in the church.  But I was under the impression that you
yourself are gay.  That's all well and fine, but presenting yourself 
as sticking out your neck to help "repressed others" seems a bit 
untruthful under the circumstances....

Not only are they not objective, but they don't even stay constant
over time.   A young farmer and an old farmer on the verge of 
retirement have quite different ideas about the relative values of 
a piece of land and a dollar bill.

Similarly, a person viewing an anonymous piece of land, and a 
person viewing a piece of land that his family has lived on for
generations.

These values are essentially subjective, and that's why we have
markets: to allow people to match their valuations of land and
dollar bills.

The online webster gets in some good licks, too:

	1b3: belonging to the sensible world and being intersubjectively

For reason I can't quite pin down, I particularly liked 1b4.

Good question, my point was that a world with truth is better than a world
with falsehood.  A world in which it were possible to say "yes, I am
holding a Jew" (the truth) and you, me, the Jew, and the SS guy all sit
down to crack open a bottle of whiskey is better than the grim alternatives 
you present. Obviously, this is not possible, and the best alternative seems
to be to lie.  That's because other values are involved, such as life.
Now that IS just my opinion - don't confuse the claim 'objective morality
exists' with the claim 'I have a lock on morals'.

N.B., sir, I could have responded with 'according to you, truth does
not exist, therefore it is impossible to tell it.  What is true for
you may not be true for me'.

Christian:  washed in the blood of the lamb.
Mithraist:  washed in the blood of the bull.

If anyone in .netland is in the process of devising a new religion,
do not use the lamb or the bull, because they have already been
reserved.  Please choose another animal, preferably one not
on the Endangered Species List.  

Thank you.

	But, you are not differentiating between the different types of
"values". We hae already witnessed your merging of moral and monatary
"values". I would like to attribute such an attempt at white washing the 
issue as a mere mistake, but I am doubtful of your intentions.

	And yes, science can be useful and not useful.

	One need not have have the notion that science is useful. For 
example: many Christian scientists do not believe medical science to be 
usefor or worthy. That does not make medical science subjective.

	In any event, I fail to see what you mean by "subjective" science.
Are you suggesting that it is, and that if I step of a building, I may fall, 
while you may not?

	I assure you, it is a very objective conclusion that you will fall 
( without any other outside means of support ). If you do not believe this, 
I suggest you step off of a building, and subjectively believe that you will 
not fall.

	So then, it is not objectively better to tell the truth. There are 
some subjective situations within which, it is better to lie.


	I agree that it is my subjective opinion that a world without SS 
troops and the like would be better. It is also when using certain systems 
to judge the situations, such as unitarianism, that it is objectively better.

I believe that the idea of objective morality is absurd, becasuse all
the evidence I've seen indicates that morality and moral systems are
man made and thus subjective.

This is not a shot at Christianity; I would apply it to any other person
or group that advocates objective morality, unless said person/group
can provide some sort of evidence to support that claim.

Actually, Christians do claim an absolute morality, but that is another
matter.

If that's true, then it's a reasonable assumption that a person named
"Dennis" will *never* need an abortion, and therefore you're already
not paying for it, so what's your problem?

It certainly does.  There are all shades and flavors and varieties of religion,
so you can find whatever you are interested in.  There is certainly not 100%

1.  After birth, there are alternatives if the woman can't take

2.  Killing children is illegal.

Walter-

I tried several times in the past to communicate with you and Susan, but
you ignored me, and I don't honestly believe my letters were mean.  Rather
I thought they were thoughtful and compassionate, but I see now what I should
have seen then.  Call me naive.

I give up on this group.  As my Lord advised, that if you are unwelcome in
a city then brush the dust of your feet and go on.

If anyone cares about the topic they write to me direct, if not, well,
may God bless you as well.

Bye to this group.

Excellent.  Now under what conditions could such a conclusion be made, other

I think that at this point it would actually be quite easy to

You entirely miss the point. Assuming that the collective population of the
U.S. doesn't accept your offer; all that we can say, then, is that the
majority of people in the U.S. share the common notion that $1 and all the
land in America are not of equal value. This IN NO WAY makes for OBJECTIVE
value--just a widely-held value system.

These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had
expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a
direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God
is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable.
Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to 
God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in the
age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There is
repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And not just
for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew and Gentile
alike.

God be with you,

Malcolm Lee  :)

Then as you understand it, what is it?

Yes.  I agree with that.  But what does that have to do with Jesus?
Punishment you say?  Jesus did not regard his death as punishment.

Good.  I wouldn't either--not the way you understand it.

Ask Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It
isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for
a persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your
question.

Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason
why Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with
his punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that
we would "stop doubting and believe" (John 21:27).  The fact
that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise
from the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.
Without this obvious point, I would have no hope
and my faith would be vanity.

Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus
says why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  "The
world hates him without reason."  It is a direct proclamation
of how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we
need a Saviour.

And why can't you, Brian K., accept this?  How can you?  "The
world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows
him."  (John 14:17).   The animosity and the lack of knowledge
that comes out in your twistings of Robert's daily verses is
very convincing testimony of the truth of John 14:17 and 16:25.
I pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of
knowledge. I am not perfect either.  But regardless of that, I thank
God that Jesus revealed himself to me, without whom I'd also be
bumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very
Person who created me and who loves me.

Be warned, it is not my job to convert you.  That is the job of
the Holy Spirit.  And I, frankly, make a lousy one.  I am only
here to testify.  Your conversion is between you and God.  I am
"out of the loop".  If you decide to follow Jesus, of which I
indeed would be estatic, then all the glory be to God.

I will NEVER want to use my insurance to pay for
prostate surgery either, do you think I should be

What is your degree in again - or should I say when.  This is a 1960's
view of abiogenesis.  PLease read something modern like Carle Woose's
"On the Origins" which he beats these "warm little ponds" into the ground.

Look at archeobacteria - they live in areas so hot you would melt.  
                        
And, believe it or not, we use their machinery everday in the pursuit of
new drugs, therapies, and knowledge.

^^^^^^^^^^^
You mean your theory.  Again, arguing this point is like telling a child
that the sky will not fall.  If the child is stubborn you will not get anywhere.

>would be left handed.  
>
The P=1.  They are left handed :)  Really, this is not a big deal.  There are
many problems with abiogenisis but these are really trivial.

>Jack
Please Jack rad some modern biololgy - i do not mean books by creationists
about modern biology.  Pick up a text book and read.  I think you
would like Woose's "On the Origins."  He is an arogant man but his writting
and research is brilliant.

Unless Dennis's parents were excentric in their naming a girl with
a boy's name I strongly suspect that abortion might be a medical service
that his insurers were not counting on him requiring.


When an insurance company attempted to set up lower rates for non smokers
in the early 80s they got spiked by the tobacco industry. Anyone know what
the current status is on the smoking issue?


If Denis really wants to have a "fair" insurance premium I take it he would 
be willing to have DNA fingerprinting done so that the company could weed out
all but the cast iron non risk cases?

US health financing system sucks, certainly its killing a hell of a lot of
people every year.

Replace "Stephen" with "David Joslin," since you directed the same
accusation of hypocrisy at me.  In e-mail to me you wrote:
    In t.r.m. Robert Weiss writes [a promise from Psalm 9:10]
    Gee, since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical, you must be really
    busy arguing against these out-of-context extracted translations!

As you may recall, you mailed me six mail messages quoting articles by
Robert Weiss, all sent within a few minutes of each other.  You added:
    Naturally, I await your arguments against this out-of-context
    translation.  But I shall not await holding my breath...
and
    Wonder when you get to sleep, disputing all these out-of-context
    extracted translations!
and other similar comments. 

Perhaps you could explain why you ever thought that I might have a
reason to read all of these articles you pulled off of t.r.m, much
less write responses to them?

I am familiar with inductive logic.  Go ahead and give me the details
of the "logic" that led you to conclude, incorrectly, that I would
condone Robert Weiss taking verses out of context.  Your conclusion was
wrong, of course, since I agree that both you and Robert Weiss were
guity of taking verses out of context.  Nothing hypocritical about
that, is there?  

Since you reached a false conclusion, you made some mistake in your
"logic."  The only question is where.  Did you think that it would
be hypocritical for me not to post a reply to Robert Weiss' articles?
Did you make the common creationist error of confusing a lack of
evidence for X with evidence for the lack of X?   Is your grasp of
inductive logic not quite as firm as you think? See if you can figure
out what your mistake was, and learn from it.

This was an open question.  I assumed that if Mr. Archer is a chronic
liar, someone whould have documented it.   This assumption is based on
how talk.origins regulars have documented numerous cases of Creationist
deceptions (such as Duane Guish and his friends).

No long list of Archer mistakes has yet been given, so this may be just
an isolated incident...

Isn't there a differentiation, though, between improper use or definition or
practice as regards objective morals and whether they actually exist?

This is a belief, not a theory.  A theory makes predictions and is falsi-
fiable.  What you've stated makes no predictions and is not falsifiable.

Yup.  This is me.  I don't know why it crossposted.  I was accessing nn 
from another system and that might have caused the glitch.

I hold that an objective moral system exists regardless of my knowledge or 
application of it.  I relate it to the idea that there is scientific truth 
that is truth even though I may not know about it.  

Some morals I wouldn't want to change, and would not consider it progress 
for
a society to oneday say that rape and murder are ok.  Some underlying 
themes (morality, honesty, courage, respect, etc.) are used to base 
actions.  I don't consider the idea that we should have been moral, should 
be moral now, and should be so in the future a limitation, when it includes 
such morality.  Aberrances in a moral system, i.e. it is immoral to marry
someone of the opposite sex, it is immoral to listen to rock and roll, etc. 
seem to be different than the above lists, and if specific actions are given
moral status I tend to question those morals.

Ahhhh.  I see what you mean now.

But in this example it is not the values that are objective, but
the *existence* of those values.  At least, they are as objectively real
as anything is.

>I don't think I'm way off beam in saying that "something is
>better than nothing" is a rational and objective valuation. 

The term 'rational' does not apply to a simple statement like that.
You would have to include the statement within a syllogism and
assert the rationility of the syllogism.

A statement is just a statement.  

As to its objectivity - well it depends what you mean.

Values tend to be regarded as good or bad, valid or invalid, true or false,
and so on.  Objective values are those which must fall into one or other of
those options for all people - or, if you are prepared for dissent, then
they are those values which should be accepted by everyone.
If someone rejects an objective value they are regarded as 'wrong'.

Objective values require a fundamental notion of good versus bad, or at
least right versus wrong (or even just correct versus incorrect) and
a way of relating that to specific aspects of human behaviour.
In my opinion that requires a belief in a deity of some sort.

Suppose you could predict with almost 100% accuracy that Americans
believed that something is better than nothing.
You could usefully say that the existence of that value was an
objective fact.  You could not say that the value itself was
objective.   You could not do that unless you could prove that the
value was 'right'.  Showing that everyone happens to accept the value
as right doesn't show that it is right.

>Do you agree with me then that the assertion "no values are objective" 
>is false?

Well I am a believer in a God.  So I do believe that some values are
objective.  But I usually suspend that belief when posting to t.a
because it immediately invalidates subsequent arguments in the mind
of many t.a readers.

So, ignoring the idea of a God, I disagree with you.
I believe, in this limited context, that 'no values are objective'.

But I think that this thread is showing some cross-purpose debate.
I think I understand your use of the word 'objective' when
relating it to values.  I think it is an unusual usage, but I
believe you are consistent given that usage.

    We are talking about origins, not merely science.   Science cannot
    explain origins.  For a person to exclude anything but science from
    the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth
    than science.  This is a false premise.  By the way, I enjoy science.
    It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.  Macroevolution is
    a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed
    within three percent error :) ]

       Since you have referred to the Messiah, I assume you are referring
        to the New Testament.  Please detail your complaints or e-mail if
        you don't want to post.  First-century Greek is well-known and
        well-understood.  Have you considered Josephus, the Jewish Historian,
        who also wrote of Jesus?  In addition, the four gospel accounts
        are very much in harmony.

I must correct the following in my previous posting:
 
: If you are trying to be objective, you must also recognise that
: 
: 1) the gospels are not independent sources, on the contrary, they
: share much of the same material

I should have been a bit more careful here - the gospels not only
tell us about the same events, they usually use the same wordings.
Textual analyses show that Matthew and Luke probably had a common
source, which may have influenced Mark, too.

I am surprised and saddened. I would expect this kind of behavior
from the Evangelical Born-Again Gospel-Thumping In-Your-Face We're-
The-Only-True-Christian Protestants, but I have always thought 
that Catholics behaved better than this.

Friend Dennis, I urge you to follow the example of your fellow
Catholics, of who I count many dozens as my friends, and practice
your faith through good example and decent living and respect
for the common humanity of others. Please do not stoop to the
level of the E B-A G-T I-Y-F W-T-O-T-C Protestants, who think
that the best way to witness is to be strident, intrusive, loud,
insulting and overbearingly self-righteous.

The imagery in the Song of Solomon is a little bit dated (get it? 
Middle East - date palms - oh, never mind) but apparently acceptable, 
on a steaminess level, to be accepted as part of the canon. From
this fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible with
Catholic doctrine.

Is there such a thing as Catholic erotica? Not necessarily a love
story between people of that faith, but a love story that is not
exploitative, does not seek redemption through penis size, pays
proper respect to the dignity of each partner, and is still erotic
enough to have a place on a.s.s.

I would submit that the _Darknites_ series of stories qualify, also
most of the _Journal Entries_, and _Rings I and II_.

I would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography and
increase the erotica. I actually agree with you that nearly all of
the "I've got an enormous dick, and I shot my wad all over her face"
stories are crap. I count them as noise, which makes my take on the
signal-to-noise ration much lower than many other people's.

Since you are one of the few posters here who can actually write 
decent prose, could you write a few stories for us instead of
overwhelming us with commentary?

        The problem is that most scientists exclude the possibility of the
        supernatural in the question of origins.  Is this is a fair premise?
        I utterly reject the hypothesis that science is the highest form of
        truth.

Excuse me?  WHO destroyed the BD's?  Last I knew, they burned themselves...
Prove to me that the FBI, ATF, or the Government in general either burned
the compound themselves, or that the BD's had no choice but to commit
mass suicide rather than coming out peacefully (a promise that was made
twice by Koresh himself, which he broke both times).

Dennis, there are 1E6 things I pay taxes for, and that I don't approve
of, such as paying lawyers to postpone death sentences, creating
silly weapons that are never used, placing China as the preferred
nation while China doesn't have any human rights.

The democracy works by selecting the people you want to govern and 
to make sure that your opinion is heard. Remember what Spock said:
"the needs of the few outweight the needs of the many".

As long as government spending does not contradict the Constitution
I don't see any problems in a case where the people have selected 
a group of people to make decisions in one direction. And if this is 
bad, then we should elect a new government. Democratic systems work
this way, and I don't have anything against you raising an opinion
in your case. 

I just hope you realize that each individual should make their
own judgement, and posting pre-filled letters sounds like you
don't trust your fellow Americans to utter their own opinion,
just your own.

Cheers,
Kent

Glad to hear this, just a note, Osiris, Mithras and many other
cult gods resurrected as well, so there's a good chance for all of
us to maybe end up in a virtual reality simulator, and live forever,
hurrah!

Sorry, this was a joke, some sort of one anyway. I'm the first
that connected Osiris with a virtual reality personality database.
Time to write a book.

This will be a hard task, because most cultures used most animals
for blood sacrifices. It has to be something related to our current
post-modernism state. Hmm, what about used computers?

Get thee to a natural history museum or a library, Mr. Rawlins.  How
do you explain the nearly complete skeletons of australopithecines and
other primal hominids like _Homo erectus_?  _Homo erectus_ was
certainly not an ape, and it definitely was not a modern human either.
Consider some of its morphological features: small cranial capacity,
supraorbital ridges, receding forehead, sharp angling of the occipital
bone, receding chin, large masseter muscles for chewing, pentagonal
skull shape, diastema between incisors and canines, protruding
canines, shovel-shaped incisors.  _H. erectus_ was bipedal, though.
So are these nearly complete skeletons of _erectus_ human?  Or ape?
Or fanciful reconstructions?  Have you even seen one?

More along the lines of Hebrews 12:25-29, I reckon...

	See that you refuse not him that speaks. For if they
	escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much 
	more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that 
	speaks from heaven:

	Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised,
	saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also
	heaven.

	And this word, Yet once more, signifies the removing of
	those things that are shaken, as of things that are made,
	that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.

	Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, 
	let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably 
	with reverence and godly fear:

	For our God is a consuming fire.


Or 2nd Thessalonians 1:7-10...

	And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord
	Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
 	In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God,
	and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:

	Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from 
	the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;
 	When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be
	admired in all them that believe (because our testimony 
	among you was believed) in that day. 


Kinda gives Flaming a whole new meaning, I reckon. 

			      - < > -

The impression I got from talking with Livingston was that the coming
of the Lord, power-wise, is going to be something that those who are
unprepared can't handle -- kinda like overloading a fuse -- due to 
guilt. Somehow it seems to also apply to the entire physical world as 
we know it. LF suggests that God doesn't want that and has sent Koresh 
as a reminder. 

Seems that those who have been purified through salvation, or that those
protected by the Seals, will be the ones who survive. And no -- I don't 
have a good idea yet what "being shielded by the seals" actually involves 
or how exactly it relates to salvation. (Other than it involves the
marriage of the Bridegroom and the Bride... for those of you Biblical
well versed.)
			     - < > -

Me personally, I'm totally 100% dependent on God through Christ, so 
if God wants me to understand, good. If not, also good. If God wants
to save me, or dispose of me, that's great either way. Being born in
the Spirit, means being part of the Body of Christ (Ephesians 2), so
who and what I was, matters little. * What's important is loving GOD *

Come Nova, Nuke, or Apocalypse -- who cares? Satan might even be able 
to pull off a pretty convincing fake. Big deal. Not worth fearing or 
worrying about though, not before:


		   -* The Greater Glory of GOD *-
 	

Maybe Koresh is right, maybe he isn't, and it should be interesting to 
see the new message (or prophecy). The tour of the Bible I've taken in 
studying the passages he points to in the 3-02 text, has been most re-
warding. But the test of prophecy is still the fruit it bears -- which 
is not yet clear. 

Much much more important is "Charity" -- which by definition *is* --

	                   Love for GOD

(I hope Dear Reader, you've taken all this as an expression of faith, 
 and not a statement of mere fact. Seems many folks get real upset at 
 reminders. ;-)

Right.

Twaddle. You're overloading the meaning of the word "value",
that's all. Whether I care if the results are true is a "value".
I fail to see how whether they are true (correct, whatever) is
a value.

You're overloading the value of worth, too.

Like I said before, DES works whether I value my privacy or
not.

As a loyal relativist,  even you can partake in the wonders of
scientific discovery (to borrow a phrase from D. Letterman:  "Are you
like me?  Do you like science and medicine?").

Difference is that science is based on consensus.  The points above are
well made,  and obviously there is some discussion as to what the
facts are in some cases.  But if you are willing to play along with
the definitions,  you too can hit the jackpot.  Science also tends to
use the principle of totality (vs locality).  You can always look at a
small part of the macrocosm,  yet those miniature pieces are still a
part of the total essence.  So the facts to observe are those which
pertain to what questions you're asking.  You may place a value on the
questions,  but in many case,  they are being asked just for the sake
of asking.  And you can say that you're looking at a signal instead of
listening to noise,  but the beauty of science is that it takes both
into account (the totality aspect).  For science to say that light is
a wave and NOT a particle (or vice versa) would be to ignore the total
essence that is light (which is based upon the agreed upon definitions).

Why even have definitions?  Why agree upon them?  Well, to communicate in
such a way so that many will understand what you are saying.  Where the
curiosity and drive come from I don't honestly know.

I hope I haven't rambled too much.  (Not much sleep lately.)

Actually, jon, that is quite true.  Christian people have caused
"objective morality" to look very "relative."  After all, that was the
point of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out
Christianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own
principles?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this
apparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint:

If God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then
He has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick
physically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an "objective" morality for us.
That is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or
detrimental to) the creature He created. 

	Galatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in
	Christ Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared
	beforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.

However, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees
of the Bible,) God's morality cannot be completely codified in a list
of rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a
person's life creates a new situation to which morality must be
applied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God's
"objective" morality for us. 

Throughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of
rules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have
both principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the
principles were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.
Volumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the
application of the principles.  We [mankind] weren't comfortable with
the "subjectivity" of principles. 

	For reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference
	between the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in
	verses 21-22:  "You have heard that the ancients were told,
	'You shall not commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shall
	be liable to the court.'  But I say to you that everyone who is
	angry with his brother shall be liable to the court..."

The "objective morality" of God gets blurred by our inept
interpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors
when we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY
what God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to
seeking God's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all
figured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's
"objective morality" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he
was/is (and that's the fundamental question,) then HE IS "objective
morality."

I regard love as no more or less "benign" than any other Christian does.
You are merely expressing "approval" of the consequences I find therein.
Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my
(or any) religion.  "Love" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians
can write both the "gentle" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in
a passage that even the "conservatives" will quote at you :-) -- and the
words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, "Love is the unfamiliar Name
that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ..."

This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise
in my note, as will become more evident below.

>As a non-believer, I find Michael's Christianity kinder and gentler.

blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,
given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of "sin" on
another, and my unshakeable "disestablishmentarianism", Russel Turpin
and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my
legislating my own understanding of Christian love.

>If I take him at
>his word, he cannot condemn the Inquisitors, because they were
>also following these commandments as *they* understood them.  If

You misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of
accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form
as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human
beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) "God"
in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:

The "possibility that always exists" is that I (or, to revert to proper
time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could
persuade "Christian B" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed
constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note
that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian
argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]
prohibitions.

What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:

	A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved
	    in the Inquisition.

	B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however
	    painful this *seems*, "discipline" her children for their
	    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or
	    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example
	    "deterring" others from the same loss-of-soul.)

	A.  I point out that this "justification" of a failure in love
	    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of
	    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.

	B.  Burns me at the stake.

My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is
going on here has a *lot* to do with "cultural baggage."  In this case,
the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief
that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most
believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial
practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least
greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion
of sin in the exchange between A and B.

Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B,
then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-
ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense
attorney.  So, "one possibility" fails in this case -- as it will fail in
may others.  At the other extreme, the "persuasion" will succeed when it
properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the
Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that
many of the victims of Inquisition will have "accepted" that they were in
fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty
of charges brought against them.)

The point is that the "persuasion" breaks down when the parties do NOT
share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main
thrust of the Inquisition, against "heresy", it is *bound* to break down
in precisely the "worst" cases.  The "conservative" (I don't think that
is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,
that he is "justified" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to
a "greater good."  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow
the gospel, as if one's theories about "sin" entitled one to cast aside
Jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).

I am a "radical" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.

>(Or, for that matter, what does it mean to love one's fellow
>man?) And what is the "right thing"?  And how does one go about
>loving god? 

Well, the whole *point* of making these the "base" commandments is that
they *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a
law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful
to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a
personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great
Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were
God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A
demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping
up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important
that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  "Conservatives"
may twist this "act as if you were God" to mean "lay down rules for other
people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules."
They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a
lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy
IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation "against
God" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the "conservatives" have
confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other
people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard
American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.

>Ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo
>up front, much of which sounds pretty much the same, but by the
>*specific* acts, procedures, and arguments that they recommend.

And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged
*different* "ethical systems" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,
it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular
(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.
It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very
little, if anything, in the way of "commandments" -- so little that
the "Christians" who desperately *want* commandments go "mining" for
them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))
for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus
specifically "gives" as "a commandment" to us is "love one another."

	[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson
	 that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that
	 SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll
	 point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why
	 there is a huge amount of "cultural baggage" involved.]

You are quite right that this is "goo" if one is looking for an ethical
system.

But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our
society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It
may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems
-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.

I think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads
of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity?
[Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up
the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th
century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the
gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]

You seem to be forgetting about the life of the mother.  You contend that
the life of the unborn child is more important than the crimes of the

If you showed the same compassion for the pregnant woman that you do for
the unfortunate baby, I might have more tolerance for your views.  You
seem, however, to be intent on questioning a woman's wisdom in allowing
herself to be raped.  If you can, please understand that I am talking
about those cases in which the woman has no control over whether she

Where does this "Most Bible studying Christians think as Frank

Christians?

At least some of what you are teaching has been demonstrated as
wrong.  Has it ever occured to you that you may be doing more harm
than good to your fellow Christians?

BTW, I used to think like Frank does.  I went to a fundamentalist
church for a while.  I didn't start to really think about what
they were saying until I noticed a "God's Science" phamphlet
there.  I read it and noticed that the authors of it knew virtually
nothing about Science.  I asked church members some questions about
"theories" from the phamphlet and got only deceptive answers.  I
began to notice a very similar style of "answers" for theological
questions as well.  The only conclusion I could reach was that
these peoples' beliefs about the Bible were about as valid as
their beliefs in their God's Science phamphlet.

I have left all the above in as context.

It is strange that you mention Josephus, since Wells claims 
that historians and theologians widely regard the two mentions in Josephus to be 
Christian interpolations. I have also heard others make this claim.

In addition, Wells claims that there are areas of dis-harmony in the four 
gospel accounts. Any harmony that you find is perhaps not surprising, as there 
seems to be evidence that Matthew and Luke are based on Mark and other
documents.

Well I rather think that you have shown your hand here :-)

I suspect that many people would agree that the scientific method has replaced 
mythology and mysticism as method of finding out about the world. One might even
call it the best source of "truth" we have available today.

I will offer you a little deal.

I will read the NT, the OT, and the Torah (NT and OT will be NEB or RSV 
versions) over the next 12 months, if you will read _Did_Jesus_Exist_ and stick
to it past the first chapter. This is not such an onerous task on my part I will
admit, as I have already decided to read the 3 I mentioned :-)

Maybe when you have read it, you can tell me what you think.

     Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. You refer to
     differing interpretations of "create," and say that many Christians may
     not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith
     on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is
     truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.

     Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created
     and eternally existent are equivalent, you say "granted the Mormon
     belief..." You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to
     have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address
     and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the
     conclusion that you grant.

     The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus
     is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS
     belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.

     The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is
     nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible
     says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:

          The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the 
          kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];
          (Matthew 13:38)

          I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which 
          ye have seen with your father. (John 8:38)

          Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not 
          born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.  Jesus said 
          unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I 
          proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he 
          sent me.  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye 
          cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the 
          lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the 
          beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in 
          him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a 
          liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)

          And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of 
          the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease 
          to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)

          Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this 
          world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit 
          that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)

          In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the 
          devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he 
          that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)

     One becomes a child of God...

          But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
          sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)

          Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that
          we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us
          not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,
          and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when
          he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he
          is. (1 John 3:1-2)

     ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ:

          Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
          the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13)

          Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
          Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
          (Ephesians 1:5)

          Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should
          be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)

          For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
          God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
          but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,
          Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we
          are the children of God: (Romans 8:14-16)

          Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one
          that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. (1 John 4:7)

          Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and
          every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is
          begotten of him. (1 John 5:1)

          For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
          (Galatians 3:26)

     This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but 
     rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read 
     something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For 
     example, the fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ 
     does not alter what the Bible teaches [ "Looking for that blessed hope,
     and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
     Christ;" (Titus 2:13),"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus
     Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through
     the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:" (2 Peter 1:1)] 
     on the Deity of Christ.

     We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not 
     even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that 
     have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches, 
     you have to look at the Bible.

     I find this rather curious. When I mentioned that the Mormon belief is
     that Jesus needed to be saved, I put forward some quotes from the late
     apostle, Bruce McConkie. The curious part is that no one addressed the
     issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.' Rick comes the closest with his "I
     have my own conclusions" to addressing the point.

     Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of
     Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't
     think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the
     issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this
     subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may 
     certainly be.

"To all whom it may concern -

...

"It is known only to a few that there exists an external visible
organization of such men and women, who having themselves found
the path to real self-knowledge, and who, having travelled the
burning sands, are willing to give the benefit of their experience,
and to act as spiritual guides to those who are willing to be
guided.

"While numberless societies, associations, orders, groups etc.
have been founded during the last thirty years in all parts of
the civilised world, all following some line of occult study,
yet there is but ONE ancient organization of genuine Mystics
which shows the seeker after truth a Royal Road to discover
The Lost Mysteries of Antiquity, and to the Unveiling of the
One Hermetic Truth.

"This organization is known at the present time as the Ancient
Order of Oriental Templars.  Ordo Templi Orientis.  Otherwise:
The Hermetic Brotherhood of Light.

"It is a Modern School of Magic.  And, like the ancient schools
of magic, it derived its knowledge from the East.  This Knowledge
was never its possessors.[sic] It was recorded in symbol, parable 
and allegory, requiring a Key for its interpretation....

"This key can be placed within the reach of all those who... apply
for membership to the Oriental Templars (O.T.O.). 

"The O.T.O.... is a body of Initiates in whose hands are
concentrated the secret knowledge of all Oriental Orders and of all
existing Masonic Degrees....

"The O.T.O., although an Academia Masonica, is not a Masonic Body,
so far as the Craft degrees are concerned in the sense in which that
expression is usually understood in England, and therefore in no way
conflicts with or infringes the just priveleges of the United Lodge
of England.  English Master Masons in good standing, by arrangement,
on affiliation, are admitted at reduced charges.  Members of the IX
degree become part-proprietors of the Estates and Goods of the Order.
For further information see the publications of the O.T.O., and the
synopsis of the degrees of the O.T.O."

Again, you have claimed this, but you have never explained. You never
did explain how deducing macroevolution from its observable consequenses
(effects) is different from deducing Earth's roundness, its position in
the solar system, the existence of atoms and its components etc., from
observable effects.
Please do so or shut up on this subject.

A more realistic offer would be:

Those who object to paying for abortion can instead pay for the (greater)
cost of delivery that those who couldn't afford an abortion (and wanted
one) would be forced to go through, while those of us who do not object to
public funding of abortions for those who can not afford medical care on
their own can pay for the (smaller) cost of an abortion for those who
decide that is what is best for them, but are unable to afford it on their
own.  Funny how those who object to paying *their* money to pay for *other's*
abortions end up paying *more* money than if they hadn't objected.  People
need to realize that where *your* individual tax money goes is a meaningless
concept.  It is probably unlikely that the fraction of your taxes that would
actually *on average* go towards such abortions would cover the cost of even
*one* entire abortion.  (Consider how many taxpayers there are, how many
abortions are performed, and how many would likely be paid for by public
funds, and how much you pay in taxes and how much a typical abortion would
cost.  I think the factors on the order of 1/1000 involved will swamp the
rest.)

(It's more realistic because we don't really object to paying for delivery,
etc for those women who *chose* that, but can't afford it.)

      We all agree that it's rather unlikely (as the definitions of
"rape" and "murder" are tied to the definitions of "evil", more like
impossible, actually); but what if some society, someday, actually hit
on a good, sound reason for _why_ rape and murder should be moral?

      I don't quite parse this, but you seem to be saying, "absolute
morals are defensible, insofar as we consider them good". Which, of
course, is correct; but then you need an absolute definition of "good".

> Aberrances in a moral system, i.e. it is immoral to marry

      Hang on - what's an "aberrance in a moral system"?
Do you mean "moral codes that seem useless or bad", perchance? But your
judgement of what exactly is 'useless' and/or 'bad' is your own opinion;
subjective, not objective.

      Me too, and add in all unmotivated morals and laws as well.

Ok, one last time.  (yeah right)  In order for *you* to "not pay for any
abortions" through your tax money, *everyone* would have to "not pay for
any abortions" through tax money.  If this is the case, then women who
have reasons for "needing" an abortion, but are unable to afford it on
their own, are just "out of luck".  Their *choice* is blocked because of
econonmic hardship--which is part of why they might "need" the abortion
in the first place--and because *some* people don't want to "pay for any
abortions".  On top of that, there is the assumed requirement that the
governemnt pay the delivery costs for those women who can't afford it,
which will also include all of those women who could not afford an abortion.
This involves *more money*.

Suppose instead there *is* government funding of abortions for women who
desire them but can not afford one on their own.  Those who do not want
an abortion will have the costs of their delivery covered (if they can
not afford it on their own), and those who *do* want an abortion will be
able to get one and *save the government money* in the process.  How then
are you "paying for" an abortion?  Rather that abortion is "paid for" by
the cost of *delivery* that it *saves* (and then some), and all because
we remove the restriction against funding of a perfectly legal procedure.
(Notice that this does not apply to cosmetic surgery, which is often used
as an example of "elective surgery" that is not generally paid for just
because it is desired and can not be afforded.)

If you insist on complaining about "paying for" someone's choice to have
an abortion when they can't afford it, I will complain about "paying for"
the larger costs of *restricting* that choice when they can not afford it.
Why should you pay for someone else's choice?  Why should I pay more to
*restrict* someone's choice?

A pro-lifer who does not consider abortion an *extreemly* important issue
is an oxymoron.  If it's not important enough for you to vote the way you
feel because of "other issues", then why should anyone take your insistance
that "abortion is wrong" seriously?

It would be awfully nice if reputable poll institutions would have a *clear*,
unbiased poll on the issues of abortion.  In order to be unbiased there would
have to be allowance made for "shades of grey", rather than lump all of the
middle with one side by tricky wording--such as on the last poll I heard
about.  Of course, then we would know once and for all how the country
*really* feels about it, and then what could we argue about?

I think you are leaving out a great deal of other "value".  There is no
rational reason to give an "abortionist" a "value" 10 million times that
of a fetus.  (Why not 10 billion, for instance...oh, but then you would
loose on the deal.)

Instead we should look at what is *really* involved in each abortion.
There is the loss of a human life, a life that would otherwise have
eventually become a member of society.  That is certainly a non-zero
value.  There is the physical and emotional suffering of a woman who
finds herself with an unwanted pregnancy, and the greater suffering
caused by the refusal of society to allow her to deal with it.  That
woman is *already* a member of society.

I argue that the cost of suffering of a *real* member of society is
far greater than the loss of a *potential* future member of society.

Now, as for your "deal".  Suppose you "pay" the value of all the suffering
of every woman who *was* denied an abortion, or *would have been* denied
an abortion, under your desired position.  And "we" will "pay" the value
of all the potential future members of society that never became a part of
it (or *would* not have been a part of it, under *our* desired position).

Think about it.

Of course, I expect you will object to my argument that suffering of
on-going life is worse than loss of just-starting life.  If so, please
put forth some rational argument for how the life of a (currently)
non-sentient creature is somehow worth the suffering of a sentient being.
(I figure if I ask enough places, and such an arguement exists, I should
eventually see it.)

Confidently asserted falsehood.  On the one hand, people can demonstrate 
that they value freedom as consistently as they can report the rising of 
the sun.  People will disagree if you say freeedom is worthless no less 
often than they will disagree if you say evolution (or for that matter, QM or
relativity) is an accurate description of observed phenomena.  On the
other hand, even in the face of a certain amount of disagreement, it remains
reasonable to believe in the value of freedom and that QM etc. is an accurate 
description of observed phenomena.

Right, I mean that I would approve of, and if necessary (it isn't)

With a few provisos, yes.  Minimum force, for a start. And, it
depends on what is being forced (on either side).

My opinion is that our actions would be moral, and it would be
immoral not to act if action would be both necessary and effective.  
Again, there many caveats and provisios.

Note, my usage of "my opinion" is an admission that I don't have a lock
on morals, not that there is no truth about morality to have a lock on.

Good question.  Under the assumption that things are as they are,
and the seller is not the owner (I assume this is what you mean)
then one can say that with high confidence that this is a bad deal
for any tourist, regardless of their private beliefs.  There isn't
enough information to draw good conclusions about the seller - but one
could say (with less confidence) that it can be a good deal for any seller.  
That the seller and buyer come out with different values on the deal is 
*not* relativism since in fact any number of disinterested observers can 
predict this, which sounds pretty objective to me.

#Twaddle. You're overloading the meaning of the word "value",
#that's all. Whether I care if the results are true is a "value".
#I fail to see how whether they are true (correct, whatever) is
#a value.

The result's actual truth is independent of what you think of it, if you
care to look at it that way - however your perception of a result's
truth cannot match its actual truth, unless you care to follow the (a?)
procedure to obtain truth ("science") correctly.  You have to pick 
the right procedure, and note its importance.  You've got to value it.
Otherwise you don't care about actual truth, and shouldn't object
to the statement "objectivism is true".

Now if we're valuing procedures subjectively, and science is a procedure,
science cannot be valued non-subjectively.   If we're picking facts
and hypotheses subjectively, then we are using a maybe-not-quite-sure
method on maybe-not-quite-sure observations.  That should lead
to maybe-not-quite-sure results, no?  The fact that it does not seem
to might make one question the premise, which is that our subjective
valuations are necessarily unreliable.

No, wait - I've a better idea:  "And the result's actual truth is..."?
Yeah, that's the ticket.

#Like I said before, DES works whether I value my privacy or
#not.

O.K., which DES?  The abstract function DES? that stops working in any 
important sense if no-one cares for the importance of truth, mathematics, 
meaning, information, etc.  A DES chip or DES s/w?  That stops working in any 
important sense if no-one values science, objective reality, etc.   DES
does not work in a value vacuum.  Nothing else does, either.

  Up to this point, I was kinda hoping that this was a joke. Still,
it would make a great premise for a bad syndicated TV show- "These
are the adventures of the Oriental Templars... dedicated to truth,
justice, and good karma! (Dramatic music in the background.)"
  No doubt I've just horribly offended someone.

                              TRANSLATION

 The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material
nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free
from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be
established in the self.
  
                                PURPORT

 All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three
modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which
cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive
activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of
sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,
as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to
the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the
beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme
transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are
struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of
the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get
rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense
gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the
chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the
Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a
part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the
beginning of transcendental life.

 As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in
the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities
such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating
such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This
transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one
is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.

You were doing fine until that last sentence.  I believe this too,
but please prove it.

#
#That's the value judgement you're confusing, and a question for an

Impossible. One observes the simple facts, the ones that are likely to
turn up again.  Judgement call.  You can't observe everything, and you
can't test every hypothesis.  Therefore you select.  That's a bunch
of subjective people judging the importance of obs. and hypotheses -
can they do this reliably?  

#>  What is a fact?  When am I justified in valuing sensory input as signal rather than noise?  How do I know that everyone makes the call the same as I do?

"judged" to be real or noise?  How do I do this?  Do you do it the same
way as I do?  How do we know this?  Are we assuming an objective reality
or something?  Gee, maybe we are, and judgement is necessary to find out
what it is.

#
#Strawman. You're mixing relativism in value for relativism in observation.

Relativism in value => if we all pick different observations to study, it
                       doesn't matter.  We don't know which obs. are
                       important.

Relativism in value => if we all pick doctored observations to study, it
                       doesn't matter.  We don't know which obs. are
                       important.

Relativism in value => we all pick different systems to examine phenomena, it
                       doesn't matter.  We don't know which system works
                       well.  Tarot cards are science too.

No mix-up.  I still don't like the conclusions, which is why I question
the premise that subjective value judgements can never be assumed to be 
reliable and therefore correct.

The founding fathers of the US were hardly great on religious freedoms. At

I don't think that my lot were particularly mainstream in those days either.
Mind you like the Budhists I somehow doubt the Quakers would ever form a

Wooa there!!! I have a classic car. If I buy a body pannel for $300 after
being told that it is genuine BL and discover that it is a non original
copy value $50 I get real pissed. If I can get the genuine article I will
pay a lot for it because not only will it cost much less to fit (probably
meaning that its cheaper overall) but it also means that the car is worth
a hell of a lot more. Even on a twenty year old car there is a big
difference in a baddly restored car where much of the work needs to be
redone and a concours classic. I got mine for 600 quid because it was
in a shitty state from bad repairs. If it had been well repaired it would
be worth a hell of a lot more.

Are you really saying that Ford and GM are having companies beat up for
infringing copyright on parts they don't make? I find that very hard to
beleive. In the UK they are very sympathetic - Ford recently dug out
the Cortina Mk I body press so that some company could make a few more.
BL does amazing stuff, they kept the entire assembly line for the MGs
and helped set up a company to remanufacture new bodyshells.

There is a hell of a difference between remanufacturing and passing off.
The former I can't see anyone trying to stop. Most car cos see classic
vehicles as a damn good ad for them. The latter though is fraud. If a
part is described to me as real GM and money taken under that assurance
when they know it ain't GM that's fraud.

It really is odd. I post saying that the US govt does appauling things
under Regan, Bush etc. in foreign policy. The right get really pissed. 
Then when I point out that nobody seems to have posted a better suggestion
as to how to solve the WACO affair they come with the govt paranoia
bit. It's like they reserve their ability to criticise the govt for 
when they feel their interests are threatened but don't give a cuss about
anyone else.

You should revers that attitude. When your interests are threatened its
way too late. You have to challenge the govt when it is attacking
someone else's interests. 

That does not mean however that you can start calling the govt the 
equivalent of the NAZI party on the basis of an unfortunate outcome
in a hostage situation.

Would you consider the word of an eye-witness (Peter) to testify to the
events surrounding Jesus' life?


 2Pe 1 16 ¶ We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you
 about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were 
 eyewitnesses of his majesty.

 2Pe 1 17 For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the
 voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, "This is my Son, whom 
 I love; with him I am well pleased."¹

 2Pe 1 18 We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we
 were with him on the sacred mountain.

 2Pe 1 19 ¶ And we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and
 you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark
 place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.

This is a documented testimony. Perhaps further research on your part is
warranted before making more statements. There is considerably more to study
in Peters' two books of testimony regarding the Messiah. It is well worth 
your time, Mr. Brian.

Just for the record ( not that any kind of information would be
likely to affect your thinking ) I have an MSEE -- focus in
Electromagnetics -- from Penn.

A photo of the smallest logo in the world does not an atom make.
What was observed is something we can measure that matches what 
the mathematical model we call an atom had predicted.  

Much in the same way that we need BOTH a particle model and a
wave model for light, the atomic model is a mathematical
representation of physical phenomena.  A model that can and
probably will continue to change over time.  That makes it 
subjective (the model that is).  However, the model gives us an
objective way to talk about the physical world.

To put it another way, the Quantum Mechanical model of the atom
allows for discussion of the atom that will give repeatable and
unambiguous results, which is objective.  However, as Bohr and
Einstein duked it out mid-century, the interpretation of
those reapeatable, observable measurements is quite subjective.
Bohr said that the observable randomness of atomic motion was
inherent in the nature of the universe.  Einstein said particle
motion was deterministic, but it was our measurement shortcomings
that introduced the randomness.  They were talking about the
EXACT same results, though.

No, it wasn't religious persecution.  They were in the way of a
greedy, better armed, better supported people.  Painting your enemies

My two cents:

It is a sad, sad day. I *never* thought I'd be defending religious
people (especially extremists), but I *am* mourning the murders of
David Koresh and his followers. I believe they deserved the right
to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and the right to worship
as they saw fit. Those rights (and the lives of innocent men, women
(some pregnant), and children) were sacrificed to save the Federal
Government from being embarrassed. Had the Branch Davidians taken
their case to court, the black eye the BATF earned themselves would
have been multiplied many times over.

I also mourn the deaths of the BATF agents although the deceptions
carried out against them by our government were nothing compared to
the atrocities against the Branch Davidians.

Attorney General "Vampira" claims to have made the best decision she
could based on the information she was given. This is possible. Officials
in higher positions than hers have been duped. We have no choice so
we may as well give her another chance. Even if she is truly evil,
it is doubtful that she'll kill more than a few hundred at a time.

I'm considering joining the NRA.

Finally, I have one question: What happened to the Federal agents that
had supposedly infiltrated the Branch Davidians' organization (and
started this whole debacle)?

But how does one handle the nonrepeatability of the experiment? In many types ofexperiments the "prediction" is that the observed phenomena will happen again
and be capable of being observed. For example, in chemistry someone may predict
the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction 
repeatedly. You can't repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that
produced life. So it seems we could never say, "That's exactly how it happened."As far as we know that event was unobserved. (At least no one has admitted
it. :-) ) So unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability,
strictly speaking, are lacking.

I would hardly consider the BD's to be Christian.  They were acting in

that everyone will know of.  Jesus also predicted that there will be

Do you judge all Christians by the acts of those who would call
themselves Christian and yet are not?  The BD's contradicted scripture
in their actions.  They were NOT Christian.  Simple as that.  Perhaps
you have read too much into what the media has portrayed.  Ask any
true-believing Christian and you will find that they will deny any
association with the BD's.  Even the 7th Day Adventists have denied any
further ties with this cult, which was what they were.

Do you judge all Muslims by the acts committed by Saddam Hussein, a 
supposedly devout Muslim?  I don't.  Saddam is just a dictator using
the religious beliefs of his people to further his own ends.

God be with you,

I understand and sympathize with your pain.  What happened in Waco was a very
sad tradgedy.  Don't take it out on us Christians though.  The Branch
Davidians were not an organized religion.  They were a cult led by a ego-maniac
cult leader.  The Christian faith stands only on the shoulders of one man,
the Lord of Lords and King of Kings, Jesus Christ.   BTW, David Koresh was NOT
Jesus Christ as he claimed.

God be with you,

Do you consider Neo-Nazis and white supremists to be Christian?  I'd hardly
classify them as Christian.  Do they follow the teachings of Christ?  Love
one another.  Love your neighbour as yourself.  Love your enemies.  Is Jesus
Christ their Lord and Saviour?  By the persecution of Jews, they are violating
all the precepts of what Christ died for.  They are in direct violation of
the teachings of Christ.  Even Jesus who was crucified by the Jewish leaders
of that time, loved His enemies by asking the Father for forgiveness of their
sins.  I am a Christian and I bear no animosity towards Jews or any one else.
The enemy is Satan, not our fellow man.

God be with you,

Malcolm Lee  :)

Koresh was a nut, okay?  Just because he found ways for the Bible

The Koreshians rubbed themselves out.  Neither Mormons nor Jews have a
propensity for dousing themselves with kerosene, so I'm not particularly
concerned.  (Or shall we blame Jim Jones on the government also?)

Be thankful that the BATF standoff at least got some of the kids out before
the cult committed mass suicide.

Yes, and then you can suffer the consequences in our collective decision to
incarcerate you for that act. Morality is not a necessity for a functional
collection of peoples, just a set of acceptable behaviours (is this the same
thing?).  There is no universal moral standard as there are many different
situations in which collections of social organisms find themselves. Some
species of bees see nothing wrong with kicking out a large number of male
bees because they are being a burden on the food supplies of the colony. The
bees die of course, but it was for the good of the colony as a whole, so was
it immoral? 

Our society (at least our western one) is one of abundance when it comes to
the basics; food, water and shelter.  Therefore our moral standards are
based upon those circumstances.  Unfortunately we enforce our moral
standards on collections of peoples who are not in similar situations,
because we believe in some "universal morality".  What I am saying is that,
yes, you CAN still murder my sibling, but don't expect your peers to be
impressed by it in our society. However in some other circumstances, it may
actually be a "moral" thing to do (in which case it wouldn't be called
murder, probably sacrifice). After the act, you could say what you liked,
but you must make a conscious decision on whether or not your society will
condone your act, so as to evaluate the consequences to yourself, including
how you will feel about it (remember your feelings have been socially
imbued).

Jeff.

I keep trying to write a book of ideas in two paragraphs and it just comes

Give me a break.  If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth,

Does that include the right to murder little children?  How about killing
ATF officers?  I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas, but 
Koresh's folks claimed to have grenades, grenade launchers, and rocket
launchers.  I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under 
"right to bear arms."

Jesus also recognized other holy days, like the Passover.  Acts 15 says 
that no more should be layed on the Gentiles than that which is necessary.
The sabbath is not in the list, nor do any of the epistles instruct people
to keep the 7th day, while Christians were living among people who did not
keep the 7th day.  It looks like that would have been a problem.

Instead, we have Scriptures telling us that all days can be esteemed alike
(Romans 14:5) and that no man should judge us in regard to what kind of

I don't think that the Sabbath, or any other command of the law is totally
irrelevant to modern Christians, but what about Collosions 2, where it says
that we are not to be judged in regard to the keeping of the sabbath?

Is there evidence independent of the FBI that indicates that the Branch
Davidians set the fire?  What have the survivors said?  Did the press see
anything?

There is, unfortunately, precedent for the U.S. government saving children by
roasting them alive.  (There is precedent for religious self-imolation
as well.)

I still wonder why the government couldn't just leave them alone.

No.  There are two problems here:

(1) Peter died two millenia ago.  The original letters he wrote have
long since decayed into dust.  If he were alive today and I could
question him, then this might lend credibility to your claims (but
probably not much, because after all, I've heard people claim with all
sincerity that they've spoken with Elvis recently).  But after his
death, Peter's writings were transcribed by monks for centuries, and I
find it hard to believe that one of them somewhere didn't decide to
change the wording of something to make it (in his opinion) a little
easier to understand.

(2) Even if Peter did witness the miracles of Jesus two millenia ago,
that doesn't mean that your deity is what the Bible says it is (God
might just be Satan, trying to convince everyone that he's a nice
guy), or even that your deity is still alive and active in the world
today.

Nice try, but it just isn't enough to convince me, especially since
your wild claims about your deity seem to fly in the face of the way
I've observed the world to work.  Please find something more compelling.

  Well it may not have saved them (but they were Xians so they were

  nasty trial (there's a budget deficit on, you know!).  Not to mention
  the costs of extending the seige any longer.  And it saved the local

  But it doesn't save you guys on the net from having to hear me say,

  the bottom line is the same:  there's a whole lot of dead children 
  who would be alive today if they had been released back when we were

No, but you would need a lot of background reading in sociology to get
to a point where the discussion would be focused enough to be helpful.
The interaction of values and behavior among people has been a major
defining element of both psychology and sociology for a century now, and
is the part of both disciplines (as social psychology) that strikes me
as most relevant to the various naive arguments about morality on the
net.

An exceptionally good place to get a clear view of "social norms" in
action is the "micro" sociology of Ervin Goffman.  There are some very
good introductory essays ("Deference and Demeanor" is a classic), as
well as accessible books like _Interaction Ritual_.  More difficult and
theoretical are some of his later books like _Frame Analysis_.  But even
at his most academic, Goffman escapes the dreadful boredom and heavily
jargon-laden theorizing that makes most standard sociology unreadable.

Morality is essentially the playing out of individual goals and aims in
the setting of their expectations of other people, and others' expectations
of them.  This becomes "systematized" in a "socially mandated" way simply
because otherwise we'd have to invent the entire context of interpersonal
realtions with every single interaction -- and we engage in social inter-
actions usually hundreds or thousands of times a day, so that a renego-
tiation of human interaction each time is a pretty ridiculous notion.
We simply learn it (most of it) early, along with language (which is one
of the main exemplars.)

To repeat what I had said in an earlier post:  Evolution is
a theory.  If you accept it as fact, then that is faith and
not much different from religion.  If you accept it as the
theory it is, then there is 0% religion involved and it 
can be quite useful in the realm of science.

Simply put, evolution/creation when each is looked at
properly -- theory/assertion not fact/fiction -- is a 
specific example of exactly what separates soft athiesm 
and science from religion.

	(Wouldn't it be nice if Subject: lines had something to do

	I wonder if the Universe would look like a Black Hole
from "outside"? How could we posit an "Outside", whether called
DeSitter space, hyperspace, parallel universes, whatever?

	Suppose that such a space existed, and that our universe
looked like a Black Hole in it. Then our Universe could be open
to it through Hawking radiation, the same way Black Holes are
within our Universe. Note this is all the purist speculation
and noone knows what laws govern QM beyond the event horizon
of our universe. Can laws change at such boundaries of space-time?

And I maintain:

Some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that
they alone are their own masters, because they fear it; they are too
afraid of having to face the world on their own terms.  And so, by
their own choice, they will remain in darkness, sort of like bugs
under a rock.  However, some people, but not many, will not like the
darkness.  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable.
These people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded
at first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  And,
after a while, now that they can see things for what they really are,
they will also see the heights which they can reach, and the places
they can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through the
world, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their
successes.

They will see that there is much much more to the world than just the
narrow experiences under the rock.  They will discover that life under
a rock was incredibly yucky, and that life on their own terms is great
-- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it.

Do you see my point?  I think you're the one under the rock, and I'm
getting a great tan out here in the sunlight.  My life has improved
immesurably since I abandoned theism -- come and join me!  It will be
a difficult trip at first, until you build up your muscles for the
long hike, but it's well worth it!

Look, you just practically equated Odin and Zeus?  They're as much
different as your god is from them...

Don't you see?  I'm not going to accept ANYTHING that I can't witness
with my own eyes or experience with my own senses, especially not
something as mega-powerful as what you're trying to get me to accept.
Surely if you believe in it this strongly, you must have a good

>Withough checking his own

When did I say that?  I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead
of being subject to the whims of a deity, but that if the deity
decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am, then so be it.

Nope -- most people are Christian.  Most people are fond of feeling
that they are imperfect, of believing that the world is an undesirable
place, of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and
holy again, of doing just as their priests tell them, like good little
sheep.  You enjoy darkness, and you're proud of it.

You may know the Bible well -- but have you read any of the Koran?  Or
Zen writings?  Or Hare Krishna literature?  If you haven't, then how
can you say you have an open mind?

>Sin is fun!  Let's
>admit it.  But a life of sin leads to trouble and death in this

Nope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your
failures; then you die.  If you are content with the life you've led
as you reflect back on it in your final moments, then you've led a
good life.

I'm sorry, I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god
I'd worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in
which case it's not really all that important.

Forget the Bible for a minute.  Forget quoting verses, forget about
who said what about this or that.  *Show me.*  Picture just you and me
and a wide open hilltop, and convince me that you're right.

I would just go fetch my parents, and show them to you, and thereby
prove quite definitively that my mother is not named Merlyn, she is
not nine feet tall, and my father is quite alive.

Then I would assert quite simply that your deity does not exist, and
wait for a similar demonstration from you.

The argument by Jawad Ali is funny, He writes:
"The converse would be that the problem is that Muslims dont consider
Ahmadies to be Muslims"

Which is a wrong statement. In the light of Dr. Ijaz's statement, the
above statement should be corrected:
".......................................is that (some) non-Ahmadi Muslims
don't consider Ahmadi-Muslims as Muslims"

So, the problem does not get solved:-) Who is a muslims and who is not?
Humans cannot decide. Humans may not declare others faiths. Its that 
simple. I don't understand, why the mere use of the word "ISLAM" is
becomming such a big issue. I have seen numorous postings on the net
on this subject, and all they say, "No, NO, you cannot use ISLAM as 
the name of your newsgroup". ?? 

I haven't seen a single posting stating what right do they have in declaring
the name of other's faiths? Who gives them this authority? Quran? or
Hadith? or something else? I want to know this! 

Just a small reminder to all my Muslim Brothers, Did _EVER_ the 
Holy Prophet of Islam (Muhammad PBUH), say to anyone who called
himself a Muslim:

No, You are not a Muslim ! ???????

NEVER! I challenge all my Muslim brothers to produce a single 
such evidence from the history of Islam!

Hence, if the Prophet Muhammad could never do that to anyone, how
could the Muslims, Mullahs or even Governments of today do
it to anyone. Do you consider yourself above the Holy Prophet 
Muhammad (PBUH) ?? 


Sincerely,
Nabeel.

Another dodge.  Oh well.  I'm no match for your amazing repertoire
of red herrings and smoke screens.  

You asked for an apology.  I'm not going to apologize for pointing out
that your straw-man argument was a straw-man argument.  Nor for saying
that your list of "bible contradictions" shows such low standards of
scholarship that it should be an embarrassment to anti-inerrantists,
just as Josh McDowell should be an embarrassment to the fundies.  Nor
for objecting various times to your taking quotes out of context.  Nor
for pointing out that "they do it too" is not an excuse. Nor for calling
your red herrings and smoke screens what they are.

I'm still not sure why you think I'm a hypocrite.  It's true that I
haven't responded to any of Robert Weiss' articles, which may be due in
part to the fact that I almost never read his articles.  But I have
responded to both you and Frank DeCenso (a fundie/inerrantist.)  Both
you and Frank have taken quotes out of context, and I've objected to
both of you doing so.  I've criticized bad arguments both when they
were yours and I agreed with the conclusion (that the Bible is not
inerrant), and when they were Frank's and I disagreed with the
conclusion.  I've criticized both you and Frank for evading questions,
and for trying to "explain me away" without addressing the objections
I raise (you by accusing me of being hypocritical and irrational, Frank
by accusing me of being motivated by a desire to attack the Bible.) I
don't see that any of this is hypocritical, nor do I apologize for it.

I do apologize, however, for having offended you in any other way.

Happy now?

We have no way to know that the cultists burned the house; it could have been
the BATF and FBI.  We only have the government's word for it, after all, and
people who started it by a no-knock search with concussion grenades are hardly
disinterested observers.

If you were arguing with a group of people likely to contain flat-earthers, and
did not mention the sphericity of the Earth but instead made a comment which
used it as a hidden assumption and was otherwise phrased so that flat-earthers
would agree with it, yes....

Agreed. But your original posting seemed to me to be just another

Your original posting shows that you seem to think chemists still think
this way. It is true that basic chemistry is still taught in terms of
electron pairs and valences, but this is not what _chemists_ are taught, 
and this is not how they should think. 

I suggest you take a look at P.W. Atkins's classic text _Physical Chemistry_
(4th ed., Oxford University Press 1990) to see how chemistry is taught today.

However, I still agree with your point - concepts must be allowed to
operate at a pragmatic level. In chemistry, this usually means we must use
different models for different situations. It is unfair to say that
chemists simply ignore effects they can't deal with - on the contrary,
they are quite concerned with the limitations of their models.

If someone insists that electron is _confined_ inside these shapes,
it would indeed constitute a joke. The shapes are still important, 
even though they are only visual representations of the radial and
angular functions. The surfaces are arbitrary, and not really important - 
what is more important (in chemistry) are the signs of the wavefunctions.

Is there something wrong with the representations?

This is sort of like asking an atheist "would you like to prove that God
doesn't exist"?  Doubting something does not imply affirming the contrary.

For that matter, what if I don't accept the concept that there is something as
well-defined as "Western policies", but only that there are policies of
individual Westerners which do not form a coherent combined policy?

Sigh, see what our school systems are producing?  Total confusion!
The original English settlers were, probably, the most intolerant lot
of people to ever assemble.  However, the Founding Fathers
(Washington, Jefferson, Madison, etc.), practically made it their
life's work to ensure that religious intolerance would not destroy
their great experiment... a democratic republic.

I strongly suggest that those interested get some of Jefferson's and
Madison's writings. Particularly good is Madison's "(something)and
Remonstrance", [yea, I'm litterate and have functioning memory cells

who ever lived. Although both were products of their time (Jefferson
was a slave owner), they were able to see more clearly than their
contemporaries, and for that matter, more clearly than most modern
politicians. Their prose is the epitome of eloquence. I don't know
about y'all, but reading the Declaration of Independence give me
mental goosebumps. (For those who have never read it, I am appending a

In CONGRESS, July 4, 1776

The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with
another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and
equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle
them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they
should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of
Happiness.  That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted
among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
governed.  That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of
these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it,
and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such
principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall
seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  Prudence,
indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be
changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience
hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are
sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which
they are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations,
pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them
under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to
throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future
security.

Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is
now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems
of Government.  The history of the present King of Great Britain is a
history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct
object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.  To
prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary
for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing
importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should
be obtained, and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend
to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large
districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of
Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and
formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,
uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public
Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with
his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with
manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause
others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of
Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise;
the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of
invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that
purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners;
refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and
raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his
Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of
their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of
Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies, without the
consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to
the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to
our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to
their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders
    which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring
    Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and
    enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example
    and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into
    these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and
    altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested
    with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protection
and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and
destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to
complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun
with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the
most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized
nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas
to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of
their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured
to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian
Savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction
of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in
the most humble terms.  Our repeated Petitions have been answered only
by repeated injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every
act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free
people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren.
We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature
    to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.
We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and
    settlement here.
We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity,
    and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow
    these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections
    and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice 
    and of consanguinity.
We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our
    Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies 
    in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in
General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the
world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by the
authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and
declare.  That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be
Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all
Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection
between them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally
dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full
Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish
Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States
may of right do.  And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm
reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to
each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.

And as an agnostic who's slightly aware of the Mormon Wars that Casper
describes, I'd side with him on this. Not that I support the Koreshians, nor
do I support the Mormons, but in a nasty sense, the major difference is
this; in 1857, the Mormons kicked the U.S. Army's ass. In 1993, the
Koreshians died in an inferno. Chances are, if things had turned out a
little differently, we might have Koreshians posting to the Net a hundred
years from now talking about some future, analogous event.

Sigh, I was waiting some some not-so-intelligent person to bring this
up.  Look, this is a country of laws. To quote a piece of parchment
that many seem to think is of little importance:

 4th Amendment
 The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, 
 papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, 
 shall not be violated; and no warrants shall issue, but upon 
 probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and 
 particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons 
 or things to be seized. 

No, a no-knock warrant is in clear violation of the 4th amendment.
Okay, what about the fact that they were tipped off - they shouldn't
have opened fire - right?  WRONG!  Think about this: I am a drug
dealer and my competition wants to do away with me. They call me and
tell me that the Feds are on their way with a no-knock warrant. So,
being moronic sheep we wait, with our guns holstered. Now, instead of
the Feds, in comes my competition, and we're history.  The only
acceptable answer to a no-knock warrant is blazing guns!  I may sound
paranoid, but our government is out of control, and killing a few
federal officers make knock some sense back into it.

So what if the FBI wasn't aware of suicide plans?  This may not even be an
]accurate statement, anyway, since the last report of listening devices used
in the compound may reveal new information.  We'll have to wait.
   And what did you expect Koresh's attorneys to say?  Their credibility
is shot anyway, since they *origianlly* said that Koresh was going to surrender
after the Passover.  We saw how accurate that was.
   And the survivors claim the fire was started from the outside.  Outside 
meaning outside the compound?  Yes, the FBI reported seeing two people
(according to CNN reports) using torches to set the compound on fire.   They
were outside.

   Either way, I have evidence to support the theory that the BD's burned
themselves.  You made a serious implication that the FBI was responsible
for the fire and the "destruction of the people".  All you have done is
put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back
up your claim that the FBI was responsible.

	Viewing from the net's initial reaction to the self-immolation of the
Branch Davidians, it would appear that this human tragedy is too flagrant
for some folks to keep from using it to push their peevish little ideologies.
(Others could not help but exercise comic relief, but given the tension, I
think this reaction is understandable.) My rasberry award goes to Dave Palmer
who makes the following benediction after spewing out the facts,

	"Score another one for the forces of ignorance and superstition"

as if the public deaths of over 80 people were not a clear and definite 
warning as to what happens to people who follow false prophets.

	From where I set, looks like Satan has a three-bagger going.

	One thing that should be made clear is that neither the FBI nor
the BATF is responsible for what happened yesterday. One can argue about
the initial raid, but it would be worth mentioning, before the facts get
lost, that

	1. The Branch Davidians were tipped off that the BATF was coming
	during the initial raid.

	2. The Branch Davidians opened fire first.

	It is also worth noting that the Branch Davidians, according to
the FBI's statements, opened fire immediately when the FBI issued the warning
over the phone, and that the vehicle which launched the tear gas grenades
did so under fire from the compound.

	Clearly, no one in the government wanted a repeat of the initial 
shootout, That's why they went in with riot control gas. This would have worked
with minimal casualties (The Branch Davidians apparently did not have gas
masks) if Koresh had not had a very different reaction in mind.

	The question is whether yesterday's raid was wired tightly enough.
Reno and Sessions both made statements to the press indicating that the
experts had not indicated that such a reaction was (possible ?) (likely ?).
They both indicated that they had no idea that a Masada-like mass suicide
could result from the introduction of non-lethal agents into the compound.

	Some of these issues are highly technical - the impression I have
is that the "Ranch Apocalypse" represented a Rubrik's cube for the
counterterrorist types. The Branch Davidians were too well armed for 
for a simple assault (the BATF found this out the hard way). The complex
was probably to big for the kind of "surgical" Delta Force coup de main
that the Bundesgrenschutz did in the 1970s when one of their airliners
was highjacked by "Black September". The reason this seige had gone on
as long as it had was that the government really didn't have any good options,
and to wait it out was the safest and most logical choice.

	My own theory is that something was supposed to have happened
on Easter. Koresh had made some statements building that idea up, and 
Easter came and went with nothing happening. It may be that the authorities
felt emboldened to move for this reason. IT IS just a theory.

	I don't believe this is a valid argument. Obviously, hindsight

	I imagine there are a good many people who are having some problems
processing the reality of this affair now. 

	1. This matter ties in with the infamous "social scientists are not
	really scientists" brouhaha on sci.skeptic. Here is a case where, if
	one believes the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, the
	predictions of psychological experts were proven false, not under
	laboratory conditions, but in the cauldron of practical application.

	2. Koresh's actions (or the actions of whoever started the fire - 
	we're not likely to know what went on in there) contrast so violently
	with the example of Christ that I'm sure many Christians find it
	difficult to understand why or how this happened. Under such 
	conditions, the search for scapegoats is only too natural a human
	reaction, even though that is not a particularly Christian response
	either.

	3. Koresh's mother apparently had some false hopes that the cult 
	members had sought refuge in a bunker somewhere in the complex. Her 
	grief must be monumental at this time, and the search for a way to
	escape moral responsibility for her family's destruction is likewise
	real. We may not have seen the end to the self depravation.

	4. The fact, simply stated, is that a good number of innocent children
	and not-so-innocent adults died horribly for no good reason. It is
	exceptionally hard for us, as human beings, to accept this fact.
	We can hope for some ultimate salvation, some panacea to make it
	better, but even though hope is a wonderful thing, that doesn't
	make it so. There is no meaning to this thing. It just is.

I've asked your god several times with all my heart to come to me.  I
really wish I could believe in him, 'cos no matter how much confidence

so nice to know I have someone watching over me in it...

I've gone into this with an open mind.  I've layed my beliefs aside
from time to time when I've had doubt, and I've prayed to see what
good that would do.  I don't see what more I can do to open myself to
your god, short of just deciding to believe for no good reason.  And
if I decide to believe for no good reason, why not believe in some
other god?  Zeus seems like a pretty cool candidate...

All I know is that in all my searching, even though I've set aside my
pride and decided that I want to know the truth no matter how
difficult it may be to accept, I have never had any encounter with any
deity, Christian or otherwise.

Please tell me what more I can do while still remaining true to myself.

Make those predictions and don't waste our time with circular definitions
and assertions without evidence. In this example, when genocide is so
commonly abhorred, why does it happen so often in the context of religion?
Does it allow to conclude that there is something about religion that
catalyses genocide? Or, in case it has nothing got to do with religion,
that the premise is wrong, genocide is not abhorred?

This group killed itself to fulfill its interpretation of prophecy
and to book a suite in Paradise, taking innocent kids along for the
ride. I hardly think the feds were motivated by persecution. If they
were, all Koresh would have had to do was surrender quietly to the
authorities, without firing a shot, to get the American people behind
him and put the feds in the hot seat. But no, God told him to play
the tough guy. There's great strength in yielding, but few appreciate
this.

I don't think that the universe would look like a black hole from
the outside, because that would imply that similar to a black hole we

I am personally convinced that what we call our "universe" is only a
small part of a larger system. Further, I think that it is logically 
necessary for the laws of our universe be confined to this universe
itself.

Why do I believe this? It is simple; I believe that the odds against
there being only one universe and that universe having the right conditions
to support us are infinate. I believe that to explain our existance in
this universe it is necessary to either consider multiple universes
(an infinate number of them) or intelligent design. Since the only
intelligence that we know of is of a higher order than simple matter
(the brain is made of matter) by Ockham's razor I go for the first
choice.

What's more, there are a couple of books out dealing with popular
science that use parallel universes and holographic universes (which
is another way of saying parallel) to explain the behavior of particals
at the quantum level. One is called Parallel Universes, and I think it
is by Wolf, the other The Holographic Universe.

BTW, the parallel universe approach implys an element of mind in the
very physical reality of the universe.

I appreciate the narrow-mindedness of the view expressed in
the text you quoted.  I also appreciate your being amused
by such determined ignorance.  Without taking anything away
from your mirth, I want to say that these views sadden me.
I can only hope that that sort of narrow-mindedness will
die with the generations that have promoted it.  Teach 
your children well.

Evolution, as I have said before, is theory _and_ fact.  It is exactly
the same amount of each as the existence of atoms and the existence of
gravity.  If you accept the existence of atoms and gravity as fact,
then you should also accept the existence of evolution as fact.

Before you go absolving the BATF & FBI of all blame in this incident, you should
probably be aware of two important facts.
1.  There is no such thing as non-toxic tear gas.  Tear gas is non-breathable
    remaining in it's presence will cause nausea and vomiting, followed eventually
    by siezures and death.  Did the FBI know the physical health of all the people
    they exposed??  Any potential heart problems among the B-D's??

2.  Have you ever seen a tear gas canister??  Tear gas is produced by burning a
    chemical in the can.  The fumes produced are tear gas.  The canister has a 
    warning printed on the side of it.  "Contact with flamable material can result
    in fire."  Now, how many of these canisters did they throw inside a building 
    they admited was a fire-trap??

This whole thing was a case of over-reaction by the officials at every step.
I hope it is thoroughly investigated and the responsible parties are held
accountable.  But that is highly unlikely when you figure they are going to
be investigating themselves.

Yes, but tell me how you think your question answers my question. If
the BDs didn't know immediately that they were dealing with feds
(uniform apparel, insignia), they must have figured it out in pretty
short order. Why did they keep fighting? They seemed awfully ready
for having been attacked "without warning".

Actually, after surviving being driven out of Nauvoo, and later Carthage,
the Mormons DID fortify Utah.  They still arm themselves to "defend the
faith", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite a
lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives
for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their
sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.

So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very
impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defend
secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually
do - even to the point of suicide.)  So he hired virtually no one but
Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the
Church of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI
personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.

I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatment
of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.

 HEAVILY ARMED RELIGIOUS CULT BATTLES GOVERNMENT

 Troops have been called out after a skirmish involving government
 officials and a religious cult which has been gathering weapons in their
 "private city".

 The cult's leaders, who claim that God speaks to them, have told cult
 members to arm themselves in preparation for the end of the world, which
 they believe to me imminent.

 Weapons believed to be in their possession include large-bore military
 weapons as well as sporting arms.  A recent series in nearby newspapers
 has exposed the plans of the cult to take power throughout the region.

 Troops have surrounded the cult's "city" after incidents in which
 officials have exchanged shots with cult members.  There have been
 reports of children being seen in the cult compound, where discipline is
 said to be strictly administered.

 Governor Liliburn Boggs has issued an order that these "Mormons" are to
 be exterminated, or driven from the state..

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

And that's the news account, from 150 years ago..

Since the jury's not yet in on exactly how the fire REALLY started, the
only dead children here for whom blame can be proven at the moment were 
the ones shot by government fire.

A citizen has the right to stop ANY attacking criminal -- even one with 
a uniform.  Clothing aside, you know, it's still not legal to serve a
search warrant with a concussion grenade.

Well then, find out.

By the way, this is not a claim of "Koresh's folks," it is a claim of 
the government -- the same government which DID have grenades and grenade
launchers and DID use them.  No one has seen ANY evidence of the BD's 
having, much less using, such weaponry.  If they were stocking such things 
against Armageddon, why would they have left them in the boxes when 
Armageddon actually arrived?

See above, for one example.  The "abuses" involved were non-mainstream 
religious beliefs, polygamy, child abuse, and fortification.  Sound
familiar?  In my opinion, the BD's were as much a real threat to society
as the Mormons were then or are now.  (That is, until they were provoked.)

By the way, I find your statement about "non-Nazi" law ironic.  Koresh was 
suspected of violating the Gun Control Act of 1968, which was BASED ON the
text of the Nazi Weapons Law of March 18, 1938.  ("Gun Control's Nazi 
Connection;" Jews for Preservation of Firearms Ownership, 2872 S. 
Wentworth Ave., Milwaukee, WI 53207, (414) 769-0760.)

By the way, what was Koresh's specific violation?  FAILURE TO PAY A TAX.
That's right -- the BATF are TREASURY agents.  Did a failure to pay a
$200/gun tax really justify armed attack, night torture, and ultimately
the death penalty?

   See, this is what really bugs me about this whole incident, and
   also about Usenet:  Here we are almost two months after the original
   raid, a raid witnessed by several members of the press, and there is 
   STILL no agreement about the basic facts.  Riggs, here, and others,
   are claiming that the BD's shot first, while others on the net claim
   that the feds did, in the form of concussion grenades.  

   I suggest that before ANY of you make any claims about who shot 
   first, you DOCUMENT your claim with actual evidence, and not just
   FOAF or "he said / she said".     Otherwise don't use words like
   "fact" above - it just makes you all look stupid.

All government claims.  If they were really stocking such weapons for

"The time is coming.  Those of you who have no sword, sell your shirt and
 buy one... And they told him, Master, we have two swords.  And he said, It 
 is enough."  (LUKE ...)

"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace,
 but the sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father,
 and the daugher against her mother..."  (MATT 10 34-35)

Just maybe you won't be home.  Then you can come home to something 
like this:

    "Well, it's been a rough month," begins Johnnie Lawmaster.  "I
 just get laid off, and my divorce became final.  But I just wasn't
 ready for what happened this particular Monday."

    That particular Monday was was December 16, the first day of the
 Bill of Rights' third century, the day when federal agents and local
 law enforcement officer broke into the house in Tulsa that always flew
 the U.S. flag.  When Lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak
 afternoon, one of his neighbors had some news.

    "'Ohmigod, John, you are in big trouble!' my neighbor tells me.
 'Sixty police, federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house,
 kicked down the door, cut locks off your gun safe.'  I couldn't
 believe it.  Then I walked inside.  What a nightmare."

    It was no nightmare; it was horribly real life.  Apparently acting
 on information the Lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm, some thirty
 agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) teamed up
 with state and Tulsa police authorities, search warrant in hand, to
 search for a "Colt, AR-15, .223 caliber machine gun, unknown serial
 number."  The warrant, issued by U.S. Magistrate John Leo Wagner, also
 authorized agents to seize "any tools used in the alteration or
 modification of firearms, such as files or drills; documents, papers,
 books, records, and other tangible properties which identify occupants
 or owners of the property to be searched...."

    Reports vary, but according to neighbors, the joint task force
 operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital
 involved some 60 agents and local law enforcement personnel against
 Lawmaster.  They cordoned off the street; took station with weapons
 drawn in the back yard; used a battering ram to break through the
 front door; kicked in the back door; broke into his gun safe; threw
 personal papers around the house; spilled boxes of ammunition on the
 floor; broke into a small, locked box that contained precious coins;
 stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles, breaking the table
 in the process.  Then, they left.  The doors were closed but not
 latched, much less locked.  The ammo and guns were left unsecured.

    "My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted
 through and couldn't latch.  Anybody could have waltzed in there and
 stolen everything I own.  A child could have taken a gun.  The guns,
 the safe -- everything was open and laying around.  I keep all my
 magazines empty, but someone had loaded them.  While I was looking
 around in amazement, the gas, electric and water companies show up to
 turn the power off.  They said they were told to shut things down.
 Then I found the note.  "Nothing Found - ATF."

    "They didn't make any attempt to notify me.  I've lived in Tulsa
 all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket.  How come they
 can't look that up, realize I've been law-abiding my whole life, then
 come to the door when I'm home?  They didn't leave someone here to
 watch over my private property.  They didn't even come by to explain
 what happened.  They just raided my home, ransaked it, left it wide
 open and left."

    Lawmaster placed a phone call to the local BATF agent.  "I asked,
 'Are you gonna' arrest me?' and he said, 'No.'  I asken him, "Who is
 going to repair and clean up my house?'  And he said, "If you're going
 to talk to me, come down to my office.'

    "'I can't come down!' I said.  'My doors are broken!'  If I had
 been on vacation and I didn't have friendly neighbors, I would have
 lost everything I own.  Here I am a competent, responsible firearms
 owner, and the government leaves them open, unlocked, with ammo strewn
 around."

    Lawmaster said the agent advised him, "If you want your door to
 lock and your gun safe to lock, you're gonna' have to pay for it
 yourself."

    "'Oh, I'll come right down, alright,' I told him.  'I'll come
 down, but I'll bring my attorney.'  And he said, 'Well, you bring
 your attorney, and we won't talk to you.'"


So if you don't want your tea party to be held in awkward silence, make
sure your lawyer isn't there, there's a good chap.

What a repulsive outlook on society.  "Followers of unusual religions
may be killed by the government -- it simply can't be helped in a free
society."

You and I have two different concepts of "free."

God being unknowable, I can't comment on His motives, but it would be
distressing if He allowed us to misunderstand Him through no fault of 
our own.  For sanity's sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all,
that His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes 
through immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex 
canon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another, 
or is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free
to interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God's message is indeed
mediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under-
stands the mediated message fully and clearly.  Since the responsibility 
for understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that 
God in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source 
for that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink.

Your example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality
and politeness.  You might have said "burp", for burping and swearing carry
about the same stigma today.  If you are talking about "taking the Lord's 
name in vain" as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of 
hypocrisy than of varying moral codes.
 
If there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code apply
absolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codes
could be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.  So, for
example, God's code could include, "Thou shalt not create Beings without
a hospitable planet to live on", but this law would be inapplicable to us.
Nevertheless, we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable
to us are also applicable to God.
 
But when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God's moral code, you have
a sense of the absurdity of the question.  Does God make laws for Himself to
follow?  Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category "morality"
can be sensibly applied.

Just a side note on this German translation (or whatever) of Josephus.
My historian friend says that the latest craze about Josephus is
the Japanese translation!  He says the thing is selling like hot cakes
over in Japan.  As good and powerful as Josephus reads in English, I
suspect it reads even better in Japanese!

Mr. Clinton said today that the horrible tragedy of the Waco fiasco
should remind those who join cults of the dangers of doing so.
Now, I began scratching my head thinking (a bad sign :-), "don't the 
mainstream religions (in this case Christianity...or the 7th day 
adventist in particular) just keep these guys going ? Isn't Mr. Clinton 
condemning his own religion ? After all, isn't it a cult too ?"

... bad thoughts these.

Give me a break!  What fireman should have to deal with a blaze like that
AND get shot at at the same time.

These people were breaking the law.  I agree these weren't the best tactics,
they probably should have backed off, pulled the perimeter way back, and let
them sit there with no media attention until they decided to come out.  The 
only other alternative I see would have been to send in a couple of special
forces guys to capture or assassinate Koresh.  But remember, these fruit-
loops were putting their lives on the lines voluntarily.  Why should 
law-abiding citizens have to put themselves in any more danger than necessary
when dealing with a nut?  Look at the man who jumped out of his Bradley to
grab a flaming women who was running back into the building.  Yeah, I would
have to say they were trying to save those people.  I don't think I would 
risk my life that much to save someone that stupid that obviously didn't
even want to be saved.

You don't really think he should have been allowed to keep that stuff do 
you?  If so, tell me where you live so I can be sure to steer well clear.
The public also has rights, and they should be placed above those of the

Presumably this means that some moral systems are better than others?
How so?  How do you manage this without an objective frame of reference?
And what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference, if
it isn't an objective reality for values?

Yes, very true.  The entire title is 'The Ancient and Mystical Order

is also true that Lewis had a charter to form an O.T.O. body and then
created A.M.O.R.C. (as a subsidiary?  an interesting question).

A good point.  What helps to keep such things going is the public
attitude that one should have "faith""; that some authority from
on high should not be subjected to mere reason.  Couple this with a
variety of personality quirks, mojor and minor mental illnesses, and
ego of would-be leaders, and you get all the variety of cults and 
religions that people subscribe to.

This is cute, but I see no statement telling me why your church is the true 
church. I do presume that you know or at least believe that yours is true. 
Attempting to ream my faith without replacing it with something "better" is 
a real good way to loose a person completely from Christ.

This is the greatest reason I see that these attacks are not motivated by 
love. They only seek to destroy there is no building or replacing of belief. 
This is not something Christ did. He guided and instructed He didn't 
seek to destroy the faith He found, He redirected it. 

This is what I see when people say they "love" <insert favorite group here>. 
And I have to laugh at the irony. 

Please excuse the scarcasm but it was nice to say it. 
Oh, BTW Robert don't take this personally, your post was merely convinent.

  So do you want the president to specifically order each and every activity
of the FBI, or what?  And how willing are you to blame Reagan and Bush,
directly, for the incidents that took place in the War on Drugs in their
administration?  Are you going to blame Bush for the fact that Weaver's wife,
infant, son were killed?  It happened while he was president.

Are you any less stunningly ignorant?  Have you ever heard of life

much smaller premiums than smokers?

Not to mention auto insurance being much cheaper for women under 25 than

Hoover was for many years up near the top of my hate list.  And I hold no 
brief for the FBI.  But where does this notion come from that Hoover made 
special efforts to recruit LDS members?  And is there credible evidence for 
the assertion that they are "pledged to defend secrets with their lives and 
atone for sin with blood"?  I've known only a few Mormons; but none of them 
seemed to me to fit this description.  Sounds to me reminiscent of the Jewish- 
and Masonic-conspiracy theories of blessed memory.

This was obviously a lot different than the ordinary FBI adventure.

I believe that the Federal officers had a conflict of interests here.

Throught out the whole affair, it seamed to me that they were chiefly
concerned with saving face rather than saving lifes.  Its true that
The BD were resisting arrest and that they should have surrendered
when they first realized that these where federal officers.  But they
didn`t.  

But when they didn`t, the FBI should not have treated as a hostage
situation, it wasn't.  

I think  more discussions, possible independant negotiators, and
family intervention should have been used.

Of course this is just monday morning Quartberbaking...or is it?


I don`t think I shall every forget Reno responding to Ted
Koppels Questions last night.  Watching the AG squirm when
telling us that the only reason they "stepped it up" a bit
was because of there fear for the safety of the Children.

When I think of the Chief role of the Government--To protect and
to serve....I ask myself--Just who where they protecting and just
who where they serving?

I did see a flag at half mast today.  I wonder who they are mourning.

Wee.  It's the old creationist argumentum ad quotation.  Pitiful,
dishonest, creationist saps like yourself seem only to know how to
takes quotes out of context.

Here's another quote from the same source as your quote above:

"Evolution and Darwinism are often taken to mean the same thing.  But
they don't.  Evolution of life over a very long period of time is a
fact, if we are to believe evidence gathered during the last two
centuries from geology, paleontology, molecular biology and many other
scientific disciplines.  Despite the many believers in Divine creation
who dispute this ..., the probability that evolution has occurred
approaches certainty in scientific terms."  (Hitching, _The Neck of
the Giraffe_).

Mr. King, next time you quote someone, at least read the rest of what
the person has to say before you make a fool of yourself in front of
everyone.  (Of course, we all know you have probably never even looked
at the book; you most likely copied that quote off some list your
pastor gave you.)

Another creationist builds the case against creationism.  Thanks,
John!

 But how does one handle the nonrepeatability of the experiment? In many types ofexperiments the "prediction" is that the observed phenomena will happen again
and be capable of being observed. For example, in chemistry someone may predict
: the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction
repeatedly. You can't repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that produced life. So it seems we could never say, "That's exactly how it happened."As far as we know that event was unobserved. (At least no one has admitted
: it. :-) ) So unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability,
: strictly speaking, are lacking.
: -- 

	Can't resist, because I've thought about it...

	Basically what is being constructed is a theory of abiogenesis.
There are any number of criterion that would have to be satisfied for
the theory to be accurate, such as the hotly discussed topic of
stereoisomerism.  Just making life in the lab wouldn't suffice (for
all the wonder that would engender!), because for the theory of
abiogenesis to be accurate, the life would have to resemble the best
idea we have of what the earliest lifeforms resembled.

	Comes down to that old question "Can we ever really be sure?"

	But if were to examine a claim that abiogenesis had been
demonstrated in the laboratory AND was the most likely path followed on
primordial Earth, I would look for the following:

	1)  Experiment reproduced a plausible primordial Earth
	environment;

	2)  ALL contamination sources were eliminated;

	3)  The lifeform produced resembles primitive/simple Earth
	lifeforms;

	4)  The theory accounts for differences in the modern
	Earth environment and primitive Earth environment.

NOW, if those criteria were satisfied, Dr. Abio, who performed the
experiment, would then be in possession of the best candidate for
a theory of abiogenesis on the primordial Earth.  At which point Dr.
BBio could then counter with a decisive critique keyed on an aspect
of the theory which doesn't match the early Earth environment, or
a characteristic of the new "lifeform" that doesn't resemble life
on Earth.  Were he to suggest an improvement to eliminate the
discrepancies, and perform an experiment to demonstrate his claims,
Dr. BBio would then have the best theory.
	Never provable;  constantly modifiable;  progressing ever
closer to the "correct" answer, until the evidence is overwhelming
(and even when it is, a theory that explains even MORE may take its
place) ---

	---- that's a scientific theory.

IMO, a Christian has no need of weapons.  I know it is very contrary to the
American NRA ethos of the right to bear arms, but Christians should rely on
the strength of God to protect them.  Note that I say *should*.  We are
inherently insecure but I feel that that is not proper justification to be
armed to the teeth.  A Christian should not have to rely on physical weapons
to defend himself.  A Christian should rely on his faith and intelligence.
For instance, I have the faith that God will protect me but God also gave
me the intelligence to know not to go walking down that dark alley at night.
To jump off a cliff and say that God will save me would be putting God to the
test.  And who are we to test God?

As I understand things, this is just a matter of perspective. If you are
on the outside looking in, it appears that nothing can ever enter the
black hole; as something approaches the event horizon it appears to slow,
and never gets there. However if you are on the object looking out you
get an entirely different view. As you look out you will see the universe
speed up, and ultimately will witness the collapse or heat death of
the universe without.

Seems to be, barring evidence to the contrary, that Koresh was simply
another deranged fanatic who thought it neccessary to take a whole bunch of
folks with him, children and all, to satisfy his delusional mania. Jim

Nope - fruitcakes like Koresh have been demonstrating such evil corruption
for centuries.

In a previous article, mechalas@gn.ecn.purdue.edu (John P. Mechalas) says:

Yeah, we may have to wait till hell freezes over. If they had listening
devices in place, one would think they would have audiotapes as a result.
Why, when officials are asked about what those devices picked up, do they
stumble around and never answer the question? If they have them, I think 
people have a right to hear the tapes. 

>   And what did you expect Koresh's attorneys to say?  Their credibility

I don't contend that Koresh wasn't a liar. That's not really the issue.
The issue is did the federal agents use the most prudent measures available
in "ending" this fiasco (that in my opinion was bungled from the
very beginning)?

>   And the survivors claim the fire was started from the outside.  Outside 
>meaning outside the compound?  Yes, the FBI reported seeing two people

I don't know, and neither do you unless you were there, who started the
fire. I hope we find out, but I have my doubts.
>

Could you please show us this evidence that you have? Right now a lot
of people on all sides of this issue are making conflicting statements
right and left. Some real live evidence would be most welcome!

You made a serious implication that the FBI was responsible
>for the fire and the "destruction of the people".  All you have done is
>put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back
>up your claim that the FBI was responsible.

In my opinion, it is possible that the actions of the FBI: a) indirectly,
b) directly but not intentionally, or c) intentionally (I hope not the
latter, but we would be naive to discount this possibility entirely) caused
the fire. It is possible that someone inside the community started
the fire because they "thought" God told them to or because they simply
would rather die than surrender. Who knows? 

We are left with some compelling questions here, besides the above. Why
haven't the droves of news reporters commented on whether or not they
heard shots coming from within the compound once the tank (I don't
remember its technical name) started ramming down the door? It seems
to me that gunshots would be audible at 2.5 to 3 miles away.

Why couldn't the FBI wait until Koresh wrote his manuscript, as they
had promised they would. Does the fact that Koresh lied justify the
FBI's lying as well?

Will an "internal investigation" really reveal what happened, if in fact
the BATF and FBI are at least partly to blame?

How will we ever know if Koresh broke the law as was alleged in the
now-unsealed (finally!) warrant? Certainly we won't find out in a
court of law.

There's been a lot of talk about why the people didn't run out when
the fire started, but one survivor said that the tank had collapsed the
stairway and entryway and that the majority of the people were trapped.
Only those in another part of the house escaped.

People have commented on the unwillingness of the woman who came running
out of the house with her clothes ablaze to remain outside rather than
going back in. When was the last time you had your clothes on fire? Who 
the heck knows if you'd know which way you were running and why? I think
the FBI agent who grabbed her and pulled her to safety acted heroically, 
btw. I'm certainly not trying to paint a picture of the "evil feds" 
by any means. I simply question the decisions from start to finish
that led to the horrible tragedy of yesterday.

Actually, ONE of the survivors say it was started by the FBI (tank knocked over lamp).  Another said the Davidians set the fire themselves.

Are you your own master?  Do you have any habits that you cannot break?
For one, you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand
even the slightest concept of the Bible.  Seems that ignorance has you
mastered.  How about sexual sins?  Gotta any of those secret desires
in your head that you harbor but can get control of?   Do you dehumanize
women when they walk past you?  Do you degrade them to a sex object in
your head?  Are you the master of that kind of thinking?  Do you insult
people unknowingly, then regret it later.  Yet do it again the next
time opportunity presents itself?  Are you truly the master of yourself?

I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times.
That I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake
unwantingly.  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect
of my being.  There are times I know I shouldn't say something, but
then say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson.
I, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised me
this help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully let
Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than
I myself do.  And why not?  Does not the creator know his creation
better than the creation?  Does Toyota know what's better for the
Corolla than the Corolla?

Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you.  Because Brian, you enjoy
not having a clue about the Bible.

Can you witness motherly love with your senses?  How does caring and
concern for you register with your senses?  If nothing registers
to you other than what you can see, taste, smell, hear and touch,
then you better become a Vulcan and fast.  You better get rid
of your emotions.

And I do have a good reason to believe what I do.


>When did I say that?  I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead

The topic was about my God and your lack of knowledge about what my
God says.   My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING.  You have
life forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal
torment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to 
live it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And that
was the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It's
wishful thinking.

Is this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Most
people, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that they
are imperfect.  Is "the world an undesireable place" a doctrine
of Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.  Does
Kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship?
Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again?  
Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the
priest tells them like good little sheep?  Mine doesn't.  Is this
a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being 
ignorant of the Bible?

Brian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism.
You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don't follow Kendigianism.
I follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignorance
of Christ and the Bible in regards to "priests",  have you not read about
the sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what the
purpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should
NOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.  I do
not follow Catholicism or any "ism."  I follow Christ.

>Nope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your
>failures; then you die.  If you are content with the life you've led

Why would you want to live a good life?
To you, you die and that's it.  Don't contradict yourself.  You have
no reason to live a good life.  It doesn't do you any good in the
end.  Your life doesn't do anybody else any good  either because
everyone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading
a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?

Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.
Jesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial system
in its every detail.  Jesus's death was like a seed.  He needed
to fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root.  Did
you miss the entire John passage as well?

  I saw one theist on this net talking about the absurdity of one saying he
doesn't believe in god, and how can we be sure.  The problem with this and
other arguments assumes that the burden of proof lies with the atheist. Wrong!
In philosophy the one who is making a positive argument must give reasons for
his believing so, not the negative.  If I were to make the statement elves 
exist, then it would be up to me to prove my positive assertion, not the 
person saying that elves don't exist.  If the negative in this case had to 
prove elves don't exist he would have to omniscient and know every inch of the
universe.  The same applies with god.  Give me your reasons, and you (the theist) make the case.

    That means that BD's had no plans to commit suecide.

                                                        This may not even be an

    Are you saying the FBI may have actually received information that BD's were 
    going to burn themselves alive and did not stop the assault?  Even if that
    were true, you gotta be kidding if you expect them to release that kind of 
    information to the public.

>   And what did you expect Koresh's attorneys to say?  Their credibility

    That's not what Koresh's attorney said on Larry King's Live. He said
    that Koresh was not going to come out before the Passover, and that he and
    his leutenant were "working day and night" on some kind of religious
    manuscript (something about the Seven Seals) and that once they finished
    they would come out.  K.'s attorney also said that the day before the
    assault an armored vehicle delivered typewriter supplies to the compound,
    and that the FBI promised many times there would not be another attack,
    that the matters would be resolved peacefully.

>   And the survivors claim the fire was started from the outside.  Outside 
>meaning outside the compound?  

    No, they meant that BD's did not set the place on fire.

Yes, the FBI reported seeing two people
>(according to CNN reports) using torches to set the compound on fire.   They
>were outside.

    That was the initial claim, but I do not believe it has been repeated
    since.  Anyway, I'd like to see a tape.  The FBI surely videotaped
    the whole operation. All conversations must have been recorded too.

    How come the two were not shot by the FBI snipers?

    What evidence?

    That is what the survivors claim.  I'd like to see some evidence
    that people that everyone agrees were not going to commit suecide
    actually did it.

Hang on you missed the point entirely, they are protesting the lack of
water because it DEPRIVED Koresh of his CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT to prove

You can tell that the gas did not burn because dispite the fact that
the building was full of it there was no flash of gas flame.

You make some very interesting claims here.  I'm not challenging them,
mind you, but could you provide a reference or two about the make-up
of F.B.I. personnel?   Thanks very much.

Or Janet "Rizzo" Reno arranged this personally.  Note that the man who

  What I was referring to was not fraud look-alike companies, but ones that
made cheap 'GM' etc parts for restoring cars.  They were sold as NON-name
brand parts, but had all of the 'look', so your car would be restored to true
GM, and not brand XYZ.  As you pointed out, they're a lot cheaper, so the
not as die-hard restorer can afford them too.  This is all from what I've
read in automotive magazines over the last few years, and apparently the car
companies turned a sympathetic eye, because they didn't make the parts anymore.

>Are you really saying that Ford and GM are having companies beat up for

 No, but is tell me whether or not the following scenario is realistic:
1) el-cheapo companies make and sell 'GM' parts AS GM originals.
2) GM gets annoyed, and lobbies for a bill to stop anyone from labelling
 parts as name brand unless they actually are.., or pushes for heavier
enforcement of current fraud laws.
3) Zealous officers raid the previously mentioned small companies, mostly
because they didn't have a specific licensing agreement to make the parts
that GM no longer makes.

  Pow! Instant oppression.  Who cares about the _intent_ of the law.  It's
the letter that everyone ends up following.

>There is a hell of a difference between remanufacturing and passing off.

  Perhaps they _were_ remanufacturing parts.. but then the parts would not
really be exactly name-brand.

 I can't say I agree with you more.  Perhaps I misphrased myself in my previous

  ??? I don't ever remember saying something like that.  I may or may not
agree with what the various bureaus did, but in the end it was the BD's choice
to blow themselves up, and that can never be blamed on over-zealous law
enforcement.

I think the subtle difference here is that Koresh took his own life before
he could be prosecuted.  Jesus allowed himself to be captured, and tried, 
and was sentenced to death.  That's a big difference, whether you're 
Christian or not.  That and the fact that the Bible goes on to say that he
"arose again on the third day".  Now, if Koresh manages that one....  :)
   (Note that I'm not admitting to being of the religions stated above...just

Pilgrim ... Founding forgot the taxonomy for a mo.

Jefferson etc were pretty hot on Religious freedom in part because they
were freemasons. At the time freemasonry was bing pushed as a sort of
alternative to christianity which was a little out of favour amongst
the intellectuals because of the propensity for religious wars. On the
continent the Masons were pretty much a way of denying the Pope's 
authority.

Latter on it science came up with an alternative explanation for why
the Universe existed and the intellectual necessity of creating a
creator lessened. If you don't have Darwin though Freemasonry is
probably the next best explanation as to the creation of the earth.

According to the latest of CNN reports, one BD said they started the fire
themselves, and one said the FBI did it.  Now, given the choise of two,
which do you belive?  It's hard to answer, but add that to the latest
reports (again from CNN, if I remember correctly), that several kersone
containers were inside the compund, make me believe the first guy.

Me too.  We'll see if it comes up.  More info on the "listening devices"
is coming on CNN now...I can't keep up with all this.  Though, the FBI
says that they heard no plans of a mass suicide.

>    How come the two were not shot by the FBI snipers?

After the initial fiasco where the ATF went in with guns blazing, I seriously
doubt the American public would care much for the "assassination" of two 
people, no matter what they were doing.

See above.  One BD admitted that they started the fires themselves.  It's
possible he's lying, but I don't see what the BD's would gain from that.
It only implicates them more.
   Granted, it's very weak evidence, and everything is going to be in
a different later on.  But for now, there is more evidence to suggest
that the FBI *did not* intentionally destroy the BD's, which is what the
initial poster claimed.  Again, as more information becomes available,
things may change.

I'm not sure I understand that last sentance...can you re-state it?

	Huh ??

	This kind of shotgun blast deserves either to be elaborated upon,
or retracted. Even if the readers have the slightest idea as to what the
writer is referring to, it should be incumbent on Mr. Erwin to back up what
he says with at least a concrete example of perhaps even a reference or two.
(For example, "Simon Zealotes" = the certain apostle having a nickname
connected to a Jewish terrorist group)

	Even Josephus fails to make the kind of broad brush reference to
Christians made above - he is quite silent as to the fate of the Jewish
Christian Church in Jerusalem, even though he took the time to
record the death of St. James (brother of St. John). On the subject of the
fate of Jesus's family, including James (the brother of Jesus) we learn
nothing from Josephus.

	Likewise, Tacitus condemns the Jews as being a particularly 
vicious people, getting many of the facts about Jewish history wrong in
the process. But even though Tactitus undoubtedly had the opportunity
to learn much about the Christians during his tour in Asia Minor under
Domitian, we find little to enlighten ourselves about the Christians
in either the _Histories_ or the _Annals_

	The writer's interpretation of _Acts_ is purely subjective as
stated, and so one might expect him to elaborate a bit on just what aspects
of "cult psychology" are to be found there. I can think of a thing or two 
offhand, but I'd like to give Mr. Erwin the opportunity to demonstrate his own
knowledge satisfactorily before throwing out any more hints.

	Perhaps I don't get my news from the right sources. Reading
the Washington Post practically every day, I had considered the "facts"
I stated above to be a matter of public record, and hardly in dispute.
So, if "others on the net" - and in the rest of the media as well, are
claiming something else, I'll be glad to entertain such claims in an
open-minded manner. To date, this is the first I've seen of any claim 
that the BATF used ANY weapons BEFORE the Branch Davidians opened 
fire on them. So - please -  enlighten me.

I guess my news reader deleted the lines of the 4th amendment which deal
with no-knock warrants.  How do you deduce that they are in clear violation?
Now maybe no-knock warrants SHOULD be illegal.  But until the Supreme Court
says so, your own pronouncements on the warrant's constitutionality are just
wishful thinking.

I have evidence that you will not accept that proves to me that God
exists.  I have my personal experiences that have proven to me time
and again that God does exist.  My life has not been a bed of roses
and He has been there for me when no one else was around and pulled
me through those times.  Of course, I know this means nothing to you
because it didn't happen to you.  I can't prove to you that God
exists anymore than you can prove that He doesn't.

It ultimately boils down to faith.  Whether or not you believe in
God is a matter strictly between you and Him.  I am just the messenger.
I don't judge and I don't condemn you for not accepting God.  That is
not my place.  You are not my enemy.  Satan is our common enemy.  And
the only way we can defeat Satan is through Jesus Christ.

He fulfilled the prophesies told about Him.  He performed miracles.
You know, healing the sick and ressurrecting the dead.  Jesus died
and rose from the dead just as He said He would.  He preached that
we should love God and love one another as we do ourselves.  Jesus
put into practice that which He preached.  And He rose from the
dead!  His spirit now lives in me.  He changed the world not through
the use of a sword that cleaves the flesh but the Word of God that
cleaves us from sin.

Compare this to DK who made promises of surrendering and then balked
when his deluded predictions didn't come to pass.  In the end, he 
chose to kill himself and everyone with him to hide the shame of 
being a false Messiah.

Jesus allowed himself to be killed in order to fulfill prophecy.  As
you may recall on the Mount of Olives, Jesus prayed to God that if this
fate could have been avoided He would have taken it.  But instead,
out of love for mankind, Jesus chose to accept the agonizing sentence
placed upon Him and thus redeem all mankind.  Jesus died to save 
everyone, even those who crucifed Him.  He's already gone to Hell and
back for you and for me.  All He asks is your love.

Which followers do you refer to?  There have been many who have used
His name to further their own gains.  They would have done the same
even if there was no Jesus in the first place.  For example, Bush 
claimed that God was on their side when they attacked Iraq and Saddam
claimed to have God on his side when he invaded Kuwait.  IMO, God
would have nothing to do with either side.  They were fighting over
oil, plain and simple.
 
God be with you,

The FBI says that one survivor says they set the fire themselves.

Given that the claim is that the fire was started in 3 places at once,
and that the building was being rammed by a tank and filled with tear
gas, just how did the Davidians manage to co-ordinate such a thing?

A little comment here:

Please DON't use the term "Koreshians" when referring to the Branch Davidians.
The term Koreshians is already being used.  It is the name of a now non-exist
'cult' formed in the early part of this centuary by a Cyrus Reed Teed who
renamed himself 'Koresh'.  He formed a religious group called the Koreshian
Unity which believed that the Earth was Hollow & WE lived on the inside.  The
were formed in Chicago, but left to establish their 'New Jerusalem' in Estero
Florida.  The group was fairly successful, but soon died out as they believed
in celebacy.  The last member died about 5-10 years ago.

The Koreshian were a pretty intersting group.  Today their community is now
a Florida State Historical Site.  A local historical group sponsors two 
festivals every year their which coinsides with the cult's two festivals.

I assume you are saying that no-knock warrants are 'unreasonable', this
is a matter of opinion and is not a CLEAR violation of the 4th
admendment. You say that 'this is a country of laws' yet you seem very
willing to ignore these laws, or at least those you disagree with,
and respond to a legal situation with 'blazing guns'. Like it or not,
as it stands now no-knock warrants are legal. If you don't like this
there are legal means to fight this including contacting your
congresspersons about changing the law; and, if it happens to you,
fighting its legality in court.

    The FBI claims, on the basis of their intelligence reports,
    that BD's had no plans to commit suecide.  They, btw, had bugged the 
    place and were listening to BD's conversations till the very end.

    Koresh's attorney claims that, based on some 30 hours he spent
    talking to his client and others in the compound, he saw no
    indication that BD's were contemplating suecide.

    The survivors claim it was not a suecide.

    BD's were not contemplating suecide, and there is no reason 
    to believe they committed one.

The FBI also alleges hearing through those devices that Koresh had mentioned
that he was not planning on coming out alive. 

Even more interesting are the reports from CNN that say the children in the
compound had recent gunshot wounds...  The speculation continues...

At this point in time we don't who destroyed the BDs.  Maybe it was the
government; maybe it was Koresh.  I wouldn't immediately rule out the
government just because the FBI said that a couple of cult members
torched Koresh's wood-frame house.  I think that the credibility of the
FBI and the cigarette cops is questionable at best; at worst they are
bald-faced liers.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the BDs that
survived the fire said that one of the tanks that crashed through their
wood-frame house knocked over a lantern which later on caused the
compound to errupt in flames.  Also, I have heard that one of the cult
members who earlier said that he and another individual started the fire
is no longer claiming that he did it.  Moreover, he and possibly the
other person may not have even really said that they did it in the
first place---we only have the FBI's WORD ON THIS.  I'll believe it when
I hear from a cult member's own mouth and not before then.

The FBI claims that they saw two cult members starting the fire.  They
claimed that the two were clad in black clothing and were wearing gas
masks.  Hmmm...  Sounds like they might have been describing an ATF
agent to me.  Weren't the cigarette cops wearing black?  Note:  this
is just speculation on my part.  Still, it is something to think about.
Here's something else to ponder upon:  the two agents that were planted
in the compound might have done something to start that fire.  I don't
know if they did it deliberately or not---if they did at all---but I
would like to see statements from these two agents on the events that
transpired during that day.  I think that they would be rather
enlightening don't you think?  They were inside the compound so they
ought to have a real good idea of what went on in there.  Of course if
they did help burn down the house then I doubt that they would be
very forthcoming with any information.

The FBI also mentioned that fire errupted in multiple locations in the
compound.  They *may* have said this so that people might be more
likely to be convinced that the BDs started the fire.  However,
consider that if the FBI did light-up that house would they admit to
it?  I think not.  Imagine the public outrage that would ensue if
people discovered that the FBI killed 86 people.  Obviously, the FBI
would do its best to suppress the truth and make people think the BDs
started the fire.  Fire can spread in unusual ways in a wood house---
fires burning in more than one location in a house isn't inconsistent
with a house fire.  The tear gas cannisters---which do produce heat
despite what you may have been told by the media---may have contributed
to starting the blaze.  Also, it was very windy on the day of the
fire.  Flames and burning debri might have floated over to parts of
the house that weren't already on fire.  Like I said the verdict isn't
in yet.  The FBI may very well be guilty of a holocaust.

If an unreasonable warrant is served in the 'knock' fashion, I can see
the warrant, claim it is unreasonable, allow the search, and hire a
lawyer to have the evidence suppressed.

If any warrant is served in the 'no-knock' fashion, all I
see is men with guns bashing in the door.  Maybe they've got "POLICE"
or "ATF" jackets, maybe they yell "Police".  But ANYONE can do that
with little effort. Even if I have time to take in all this, if I
decide they are police and fail to defend myself, my decision could easily
be fatal.

More likely I can't see the jackets before I have to decide whether to
defend myself or not, and they yell as they are bashing in the door,
so I can't hear them.  Or, they've already thrown in some flash-bang
grenades, deafening and confusing me.

It's not clear that more than one of the survivors made this claim.  It is
clear that at least one of the survivors made the contradictory claim that
BD members had started the fire.

>    BD's were not contemplating suecide, and there is no reason 
>    to believe they committed one.

No reason?  How about these two:

1.  Some of the survivors claimed that BD members poured fuel along the
	corridors and set fire to it.  The speed at which the fire spread
	is not inconsistent with this claim.

2.  There was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound.
	There is a very very good possibility that the FBI did not start this
	fire.  This is a good reason to believe that the BD's did.

3.  Even if the BD's were not contemplating suicide, it is very possible that
	David Koresh was convinced (and thus convinced the others) that this
	was not suicide.  It was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort.

There are three possibilities other than the BD's self destruction:

A.  They are not dead, but escaped via bunker,etc.  From reports of the
	inadequacies of the tunnels and the bodies found, I would rate this
	as highly unlikely.

B.  The fire was started by an FBI accident.  This is possible, but it would be
	foolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it.
	Sure, it's possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lantern
	which started the fire (why was there a lit lantern in the middle of
	the day near the edge of the complex?).  It's anecdotal evidence that
	has been contradicted by other escapees.

C.  The fire was started on purpose by the FBI.  This has been suggested by
	some on the NET, and I would rate this possibility as utterly
	ludicrous.  This is what we in "sci.skeptic" would call an
	"extraordinary claim" and won't bother refuting unless someone gives
	any good evidence to back it up.

So we are left with two reasonable possibilities.  That the fire was an FBI
accident and that the fire was started by the BD.  I find the latter more
likely based on the evidence I've seen so far.

So you say the credibility of the FBI and ATF is questionalbe.  So be it.
But certainly the credibility of David Koresh was (when he was alive)
absolutely untrustworthy.  The BD's in the compound were by all accounts
absolutely loyal to Koresh, and thus would lie for him.  Thus, the
credibility of his followers must be questionned.  Do you trust them more
than the police?

No, I saw one of the escapees say it himself on television.  That was on the
10 o'clock News on channel 5 here in the Bay Area.

You are speculating that the FBI purposely started the fire?!?!?  Please,
if you've got such a ridiculously extraordinary claim, and have no evidence
whatsoever, at least give us a speculatory reason why the FBI would want to
do such a thing.

The possibility that the fire was started accidentally is much more reasonable,
but we don't have anything but contradictory anecdotal evidence right now.

	Yes, BD apologists.  There have been a number of posts defending
the BD's as some persecuted religous minority, which is sheer bunk.
Maybe the press and certain spokespeople bandied about the term "cult", etc.,
but that is peripheral to the reasons for the initial assault and standoff.
It was a weapons raid.  The feds couldn't give a hoot about the BD's 
religion, but any group that ILLEGALLY obtains and stockpiles automatic 
weapons is a threat.  This goes for neo-Nazis and other non-religous groups.
	So I have this question: If your religious group isn't stockpiling
automatic weapons or engaged in some other illegal activity, why is this
event a blow to religious freedom? 

-Mike

P.S. The analogy between BD's and Jews of the Holocaust is so insulting
and mind-numbingly stupid I won't even touch it with a ten foot pole.

P.P.S. Stop with the paranoid fantasies about the U.S. goverment gunning you
down just because of your religous beliefs.  Trust me, nobody cares.

	Let me get this straight: your theory is that the FBI 
accidentally started the fire while the ATF was deliberately starting 
it?  That would certainly explain why they've been lying about the 
whole thing -- that kind of screw-up really *would* be embarrassing, 
wouldn't it?  There is of course only one weak spot in this theory -- 
we only have the FBI's WORD that the guys setting the fire were 
wearing black, and you've already demonstrated that the FBI consists 
of bald-faced liars.  From this we can immediately conclude that 
they were not in fact wearing black, and that that description was 
part of the FBI cover-up.  Who was it really?  Come on, now, think -- 
who is really out to embarrass the Clinton administration?  The 
answer is so obvious I don't see how you could have missed it.  
That's right -- it was Robert Dole and the Senate Republicans, 
of course.  And it worked, too: Clinton immediately backed down on 
the stimulus package, didn't he?

>Still, it is something to think about.

Uh huh.  

Later he writes:
>[...] The tear gas cannisters---which do produce heat
>despite what you may have been told by the media---may have contributed
>to starting the blaze.  

	Now I'm getting confused.  Did the tear gas canisters start 
the fire before or after the lantern, and when was that in relation to 
when the ATF started it?  Oh, by the way, the story I've been hearing 
is that no canisters were used, since they didn't want to start 
a fire (but we of course only have their word on that).

	As you may be able to tell, I'm not exactly persuaded.

  Exactly.  What would happen if I barracade myself in my house for a
while with lots of firearms.  Then, when the police come with a search
warrent, first I slam the door in their face, then shoot at them when
they try to enter.  After this, I shoot at people who try to get me
to come out.  This sort of thing happens every now and then, and it
usually ends up being a shoot-out between the police and the person(s)
behind the barricade.  Why are the Branch Davidians any different?

If Jesus never taught the concept of the Trinity, how do you deal with the

Also Jesus speaking:

I believe that you may have overlooked some key verses, that are crucial to
the Christian faith.

This can be now assumed kin of comic books.  There are many authors and artists
who write on, say, Superman.  This does not make the fictional character

that make my writings sacred and me worthy of becoming a saint?  Somehow I doubt

In what manner?  If you argue that the universe was created with a higher
`truth` than science (btw I would love to see you define `truth` in this
arguement) then you must state how you know this and what it is.  To subbornly
state that there is a "higher truth" and that it isyour god, I would ask you to prove it.
This, obviously, you cannot do.  Besides, if I assume for the moment that
there is a 'higher truth' then how can you prove it is your god and not 
another religion's?  What makes you so arrogant to push forward your idea
of creation over many peoples' study of the laws of nature, ie science?

Science is the study of nature.  It is open-minded: if the theory doesn't fit the
facts then trash the theory and try to construct one which does.  It is *flexible*!
Your definition of science presupposes that science ignores this god 
character altogether.  If this is so, then it is only because no evidence 
can be found of him.

So do I.  Fortunately I am not mentally shackled into constructing my

Indeed it is a wonder observing the random effects of creation.  This, of

As to "Macroevolution":  please give references and more information.  From

Is it not the case that, in the eyes of the law, when someone is aware of
something and has the capability of taking action and does not, that individual
may be held responsible for that action?

Example: the driver of a getaway car may be held as an accomplice to murder.
	 The "I didn't know" defense spawned the "ignorance of the law is no excuse"

When an individual is held as a material witness to a crime, is there a criminal
charge against the individual?  If not, on what grounds is the person imprisoned?

Not true. Consider the case of a coin. I flip it and do not look
at it. It is either heads or tails. It is entirely possible
for me to simply choose to believe that it is heads or tails and
be right. Now, there is a procedure for ensuring(more or less)
that my belief will be correct, but it is quite possible for me
to be correct without following it.

> You have to pick

No, I don't. I can do perfectly good science without valuing
the procedure. But you're just overloading the term "value"
again. Judgement of the validity of a procedure is not the
same as judgement of how preferable a certain action is, and
just because the word "value" can be applied to both doesn't
make it so. You might as well assert that "number theory is
based on values."

Huh? This is a complete non sequiter.

You're just overloading the word value, AGAIN, I suspect.

I don't understand your point here. What do you mean by "not quite-sure
observations?" It gets observed all the time that if you don't
buy into a whole series of assumptions about how science is
done, the results become meaningless. 

If you're suggesting that because science is allegedly chosen
'subjectively' the results have to be inconsistent, that's
silly.

This is just truth by blatant assertion. Your "in any important sense"
seem to be just weasel words. Imagine that I have a box which
accepts 16 bytes and uses the first 8 to ECB the second 8.
It still does a perfect job of DESing, whether or not any input
is being made at the time--whether or not anyone values mathematics..

Suppose X-ist saucers land.  The aliens destroy all paper currency and tattoo
"666" on people's foreheads and start sacrificing small children.  Then a
bunch of other aliens come along and offer to get rid of the X-ists in return
for one dollar.  The people happen to have a single dollar bill hidden during
the purge.

Get the point?  None of these events are *inherently* impossible.  So it is
not the case that the value of a dollar bill is fixed by reality.

For a more mundane example of how the value of a dollar bill is not constant,
consider the following game thought up by the RAND corporation:

You are with a bunch of friends.  You have a $10 bill.  You offer to sell the
$10 bill to the highest bidder -- subject to the restriction that you also
get to take the money bid by the second-highest bidder.

Try it.  You'll find that sometimes people will end up bidding more than $10
for your $10 bill.

   I'm sorry, I thought we were discussing heresy.  I assumed that heresy
meant a departure from orthodoxy, in which case generally accepted belief is
indeed an important issue.  In this case, the definition of the word "create"
is of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed.

  I should have said "given the Mormon belief."  If you disagree with the
Mormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally
existent substance than one of ex nihilo creation, then that is the important
point.

  Correction: you interpret the Bible to mean something very specific by
such terms.

   It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they
believe.  Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and
Lucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or
organized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being "offspring" of
God has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually "born again" of
Him.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.  This is
how language works, Robert, and it's why making someone an offender for a
word is dangerous.

   On the contrary, Robert, it is not a red herring at all to show that those
who rely wholly on the Bible cannot seem to agree on what it says.  You say
that one must simply "look at the Bible" to see what it teaches, but centuries
of people doing just that have sho0wn that no one is really sure what it says.
Are we to believe that you are the only one who really understands the
scriptures?

  Let me clarify this one more time.  You did not refer to the Mormon belief
that Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie's belief in same.  We
keep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of
Mormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it. (see below)

  On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie's words as Mormon
canon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great*
importance.  The fact is that they are not.  Whether or not they indicate
general Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large
number of Mormons.

There were many injustices in the middle ages.  And this is truely sad.
I would hate to see a day when churches put people to death or torchured
them for practicing homosexuality, or any other crime.  The church is not
called to take over the governments of the world.  It may be that homosexuals
treated cruelly today, but that does not mean that we should teach 
Christians to practice homosexual immorality.  Do you think that we should
also teach Christians to practice divination and channelling because
the witches in the middle ages were persecuted.

And you accuse me of judging?  When did you look into my heart and see
if I have love.  I have been writing that we should not teach Christians
to practice homosexual immorality, and you pretend to have divine knowledge
to look into my heart.  I can't say that I love homosexuals as I should-
I can't say that I love my neighbor as I should either.  I don't know
very many homosexuals as it is.  

But Jesus loves homosexuals, just as He loves everyone else.  If His love
were conditional, I not know Him at all.  Yes.  We should show love to 
homosexuals, but it is not love to encourage brothers in the church to 
stumble and continue in their sin.  That is a very damaging and dangerous 
thing.

That is slander.   I could just as easily say  that NAMBLA has been able
to implement legislation to make child molesting easier because of
the tearing down of societies morality due to people accepting homosexuality
as normal, and that this is what you are embracing.  I do believe
that homosexual sex is immoral, that does not mean I endorse using violence
against them.  There is a problem of hatred in the church.  But there
is also the problem of what has been called "unsanctified mercy."
Many in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in 
this country and the storm on the horizon, and have gotten militant in 
the flesh.  This is truely sad.  Yet others in other churches have 
embraced immorality in society, and have pointed to the carnality in the
conservative churches to justify their actions.  

>Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people

Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus.
But we shouldn't water down the gospel to draw people in.  Jesus didn't
go out of His way to show only what might be considered positive aspects
to draw people in.  He told one man to sell all He had.  He told
another not to say good bye to His family.  His words were hard at times.
We should present people with the cost of the tower before we allow them
to begin construction.  many people have already been innoculated to the
gospel.

False.  This story has been going around for years.  There's not a drop of

Huh? Imaginative thinking? What did that have to do with what I said? Would it
have been better if I said the world has existed forever and never was created
and has an endless supply of energy and there was spontaneous generation of

If some society came up with a good reason for why rape and murder are ok I 
would be consistent with my position and hold that it was still wrong.  My 
basis of morality is not on societal norms, or on current legalities.  My basis
is, surprise surprise, on both the Bible and on inherent moral abhorrences, for
lack of a better way to put it, to certain things.  Yes, that's vague, and the
only way I know off the top of my head to defend it is to say that all humans 
are similarly made. Yes, that falls into the trap of creation, and why follow 
the Bible.  My arguments are that it is better to exhibit trust, goodness, 
love, respect, courage, and honesty in any society rather than deceipt, hatred,
disrespect, "cowardness", and dishonesty.  No, I haven't been everywhere and 
seen everyone, but, according to my thesis, I don't have to, since I hold that
we were all created similarly.  If that makes an unfalsifiable thesis, just say
so, and I'll both work out what I can and punt to fellow theists.

Well, that got us a long way. Now define "objective value," and
make sure that you are referring to _moral_ (not scientific) values.

While your at it, take a look at the definition of "objective" and
"values." If you don't have a dictionary, I've written those definitons
in a couple of recent postings.

For those missing the context of this thrilling discussion between
Jim and I, Jim wrote the following to me in e-mail after I pointed out
that he (Jim) had taken a quote out of context:
>In t.r.m. Robert Weiss writes [a promise from Psalm 9:10]
>Gee, since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical, you must be really
>busy arguing against these out-of-context extracted translations!

He directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy, again based on a lack of
response to an article by Robert Weiss, toward Stephen.

I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and
Jim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to
understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't
have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote
out of context.  

I asked Jim the following:
>}So, according to you, Jim, the only way to criticize one person for
>}taking a quote out of context, without being a hypocrite, is to post a
>}response to *every* person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context?

Jim replied by saying 
>Did I either ask or assert that?

But today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject
"Silence is concurrence":  

m23364@mwunix.mitre.org (James Meritt) writes:
>Is it not the case that, in the eyes of the law, when someone is aware of
>something and has the capability of taking action and does not, that individual
>may be held responsible for that action?

Which is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of
context isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on
t.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.

Does "silence is concurrence" imply that Jim thinks that because I
didn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes
out of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this
question; read what he has written and decide for yourself.


But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next 
gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he
concluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide
the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.
Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help
make it more clear, Jim), titled "Inductive Logic":

>Scenario:
>A white goose waddles past the door
>A white goose waddles past the door
>A white goose waddles past the door
>...( repeat an uncountably large number of times)...
>A black goose waddles past the door.  An individual hits it with an axe.
>
>1. Given that the population of geese is uncountably large, and the size of the

>   be made?
>
>2. If ONLY black geese are observed to be axed, is it not a valid question 
>   to be concerned with the different behavior between black and white geese?

More red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large
number of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I "axed" his articles,
but not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...
Well, I can't see where he is going with this.

But I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80
articles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with
Frank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that
they are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt
where I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man
argument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)

Think hard about this Jim.  See the pattern?  Think harder.  Run it
through your induction engine and see what pops out.

I addressed most of the key issues in this very long (284 lines) post
by Dean Kaflowitz in two posts yesterday.  The first was made into the
title post of a new thread, "Is Dean Kaflowitz terminally irony-impaired?"
and the second, more serious one appeared along the thread

"A Chaney Post, and a Challenge, reissued and revised"

both only in talk.abortion, but I am posting its contents into
talk.religion.misc as soon as I exit here.

This should be enough for us to thrash out for the next week or so.  The
second post really grapples with the main bones of contention between us.
The first is more lighthearted and tells about such things as 
KaflowitzDebatingPoints [tm], which he continues to rack up on both
talk.abortion and talk.religion.misc, while setting follow-ups to 
talk.abortion alone.  His lame excuse for the latter policy is that
he gets a prompt as to where to set follow-ups, and does not follow
talk.religion.misc much; this suggests that he is being hypocritical in not
also setting his Newsgroups line to talk.abortion alone.

Most of the key issues in the 284 line post to which I am following up are
dealt with in the following post I made on talk.abortion yesterday,
modified to correct the next to last paragraph.

Dean did not.  He called them "the Great Commission" but this is NOT
descriptive of Jesus's words in Matt. 10:15.

Matt. 10:14, Jerusalem Bible translation:

	"And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have
	to say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust
	from your feet."

Matt. 10:15:

 	"I tell you solemnly, on the day of Judgment it will not 
 	go as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with 
 	that town."

In the post to which Dean is referring above, I said:

"> The above is a good description of Kaflowitz, who keeps harping on
 > shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next."
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                ^^^^

The highlighted words refer to Matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively.

And Dean countered:

"Actually, this comment of your's is a perfect example of what an
intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are, since I
specifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty
to spread the word.  In fact, it is the combination of the two
statements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to
characterize that as "ignoring" the instruction to spread the
word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are."

Of course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of "instruction
to spread the word."

All these quotes btw are from:

Message-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>

>in which, at the end, he claims I did not answer a question
>which I answered, and which he deleted (to get the chronology
>right, he deleted the answer and then said I didn't answer).

And I claim it correctly, because my question went:

"Do you, too, measure
the goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not
a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?"

and the closest Dean came to an answer was:

"Peter, Peter, Peter.  You're just so stupid, pretentious, dull,
and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that
the sport is all there is."

Of course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts
in GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this,
yet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:

"So I now restore the answer to your question
that you deleted.  If you're still unable to figure it out, ask
a nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really
doesn't take much sophistication to understand."

On top of which, I doubt that the "answer" is at all representative
of Dean's true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus
far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's 
mind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken.
One wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all
this.

He even dredges up a falsified account of
events that transpired earlier on another thread:

"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it
				^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
the "sins" of other individuals."
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

False.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins.
That I made public announcements of the "sins" of others
--"sins", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in
the posts of others-- is a different matter.

Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that
they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so
I pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,
YOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.

Dean again:

"You made an ass of yourself
by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was
somehow an attempt to "paint Jews as plaster saints," thereby
revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well
as showing your dislike for people saying positive things
about Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by
repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then
claiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge."

Actually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew
who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite
according to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing
Jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as
implicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.

I went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of
the doubt in a post following my initial crack about "plaster saints", 
suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.

In an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly
distorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as
the basis of one insult after another.

Very well put.  And, in the case of someone who calls himself a Christian
brother yet continues in his sin (and claims that his sin is not a sin at 
all, but perfectly acceptable), what should be done?  Should Christians 
just ignore a sinful lifestyle in order to not offend the person?  By 
reaffirming that the lifestyle is sinful according to the Bible, are 
they using "a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus"? 

Frankly, I find the occurance of a homosexual Christian attempting to 
pass himself off as a 'straight' Christian in order to have other 
Christians accept his chastisement better a *lot* more serious than 
people reaffirming that the Bible teaches homosexuality is a sin.

I like how, as you make a point, you breeze over *any* responsibility Koresh

          into the physical world, God Incarnate. 
          
               But there are some very important related facts that 
          Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of 
          most other world religions. 
           
               First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-
          STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master 
          (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES, 
          a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and 
          after the life of Jesus. 
    
               The followers of some of these Masters founded the 
          world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of 
          their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added 
          THREATS of "ETERNAL DAMNATION" in Hell, and DELETED the 
          teaching of REincarnation. 
       
               Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular 
          Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is 
          NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively 
          few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY 
          alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE 
          UNIVERSES.)                             

               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and 
          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from 
          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed 
          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly 
          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. 
      
               And emotional "feelings" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING 
          indicator for religious validity. 
    
               These things are similarly true for followers of most 
          other major world religions, including Islam. 
     
               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune 
          His Initiates into the "AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM" or "SOUND 
          CURRENT", (referred to as "THE WORD" in John 1:1-5, and as 
          "The River of Life" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally 
          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they 
          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a 
          "silver cord". 
    
               True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of 
          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved 
          only by reaching at least the "SOUL PLANE", which is five 
          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this 
          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine 
          Master. 
    
               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri 
          Harold Klemp, the Living "Eck" Master or "Mahanta" for the 
          "Eckankar" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, 
          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). 
    
               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now 
          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the "Sant 
          Mat" organization. 
      
               One of the classic books on this subject is "THE PATH OF 
          THE MASTERS" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  
          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian 
          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India 
          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of 
          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. 
    
               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored 
          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in 
          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or 
          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book "ECKANKAR--THE 
          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER 
          classic. 
    
               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with 
          the "Anti-Christ", which is or was to be a temporary world 
          dictator during the so-called "last days".  But the Masters 
          don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as 
          Jesus was. 
    
               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or 
          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will 
          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the 
          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they 
          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine 
          Master. 
    
          
    
          RE-INCARNATION
          
               The book "HERE AND HEREAFTER", by Ruth Montgomery, 
          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation 
          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past 
          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes 
          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], 
          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of 
          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, 
          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-
          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-
          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-
          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS 
          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the 
          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How 
          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED 
          BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the "KING JAMES VERSION".  Later 
          versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] 
          
               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., 
          typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example, 
          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually 
          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  
          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to 
          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, 
          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS 
          INCARNATION. 

               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF 
          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would 
          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their 
          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the 
          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! 



          "2nd COMINGS"

               If a Divine Master physically dies ("translates") 
          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that 
          Initiate physically dies ("translates"), the Master will meet 
          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul 
          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd 
          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that 
          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still 
          waiting for Jesus' "2nd Coming" are WAITING IN VAIN. 
    
          
          
          PLANES OF EXISTENCE

               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN 
          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the 
          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric 
          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), 
          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The 
          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from 
          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the 
          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. 
    
               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological 
          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See 
          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without 
          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between 
          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. 
    
               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a 
          sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called "Hades", and the 
          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there 
          LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some 
          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a 
          THREATENING manner.  The Christian "Heaven" is located 
          elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there 
          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth. 
          
          
          
          SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH

               The Christian religion demands of its followers an 
          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more 
          than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING). 
       
               If a person is not HEARING some form of the "SOUND 
          CURRENT" ("THE WORD", "THE BANI", "THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM"), 
          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL 
          CONTINUE. 
    
               The "SOUND CURRENT" manifests differently for different 
          Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on 
          the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a 
          flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar, 
          Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as 
          a Member.  This and other experiences (such as "SOUL TRAVEL") 
          REPLACE blind faith.

Bill Conner (bil@okcforum.osrhe.edu) wrote:

: If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then
: He has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His
: existence is outside of our frame of reference (reality).

Thus, god does not _really_ exist. How true. This claim would
lend substantial support to the notion that religions are actually
seamless virtual realities.

Does god exist or not? To us, this question is a true dichotomy.

Can god know a reason for her existence? If she is omniscient, then
she must know this. There is a philosophical problem whether anything
can exist without a time frame - for instance, if it were possible to
observe our universe from 'outside', in the neverness surrounding
this universe, it would never have existed. 

Thus, we are faced with a trilemma:

1) God 'meta-exists', and from this meta-existing perspective she
created existence, the Universe and everything. 

This implies that the universe was not actually formed of nothing, which
is precisely what many theories of cosmogenesis (Lizhi & Shuxian: 
Creation of the Universe) say. This 'nothingness' is not empty enough,
it is not the transcendental nothingness where there is no existence,
until (there is no 'when' yet, but never mind) god, the source of
all existence, started to play. I fail to see the difference between
these two forms of nothingness, though. If there isn't one, it might
be god is not necessary for creation.

It is obvious that the levels of 'meta-existence' are not necessarily
limited to god, there might be a 'meta-god' on some other level.

2) God exists, and has always existed (she has a timescale, which
is different from our own). This sounds sensible, but it is difficult
to conceive how she could know why she exists - a being which
has always existed, and is infinitely conscious of itself, can
remember that she has always been the same, and perhaps know herself
completely, but she cannot know why she exists, and how she knows
everything she knows. Would a knowledge of how a being with a 
personality (a subjective viewpoint) knows everything be this
being's knowledge? A conscious being conscious of everything is
actually a contradiction in terms - it means that god is only
conscious of herself, since we, and the whole universe, are
already incorporated in her mental models, thoroughly modelled.
Actually, a conscious being conscious of only itself is not
conscious at all. 

3) God is herself the Existence. This is nothing more than an Orwellian
redefinition of the word existence. A logical consequence of this
statement is that god is actually _all_ existence. I think this is
also called a form of pantheism.

: If this
: being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has
: defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,
: He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically
: self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an
: objective sense.

In a reality god is supposed to have created, I cannot believe in
her, is that my fault or the creator's fault? God gave me freedom
of choice, but nevertheless knows what I will opt for, is it fair
play on her side?

If god has a conscious mind, in any sense, she has a point of view.
I'd say she is entitled to her opinions about me, but I still insist
that any harm she might attempt to do to me will be met with 
resistance and disapproval. 

: If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.

No, an objective standard means something independent on _any_
subjective viewpoint, _including_ god's point of view. 

: If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that
: standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative
: morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,
: meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to
: misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to
: meet that standard is therefore objectively determined.

What standard? My morality (and my conscience)  disagrees with the
'standards' of the Bible. Which one to ignore? How to interpret
any divine standard? There is a great discrepancy even among 
Christians on this. For instance, the Bible does not condemn
female homosexuality - why many Christians do, thinking god doesn't
accept it anyway?

Bill, to reject a concept of any objective morality does not make the
term nebulous. Morality is the subjective aspect of societal behaviour,
something we can change, and something that _must_ change when
societies change. It might be some basic concepts are hard-wired
in our brains by evolution, but in the end, we must decide ourselves.
I don't think people need religion to keep them moral; 
thinking goes beyond threat of punishment. 

: Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is
: infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself
: doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural
: norm, or the preferred conduct of "decent" people, making it seem
: subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.

I've yet to see an objective standard that is 

a) universally applicable (today and tomorrow)
b) universally acceptable (not against our own concepts of what is
moral and what isn't)

: Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true
: nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being
: contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as
: much to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself, but like it
: or not, it's there.

I don't think Christian morality is of a particularly high standard,
although it is probably a reflection of high morals of the time,
and much of it is still applicable. The problem is that I can't
agree with it all. This is not a question of comforting my
conscience with a thought that "I won't be responsible with what
I do", as Christians would put it. My conscience is in an irreconcilable
conflict with the Bible on homosexuality, Paul's idea of women's
role in marriage etc... and the whole idea that I should believe
in someone I got no help from in this task.

After all, if the FBI had thought Koresh was a true prophet, wouldn't

Suppose you had the option to specify that your tax money can't pay for
abortions.  Do you think that that should entitle you to pay *less* taxes?
Since refusing to fund abortions would lead to an even larger increase in
funding for pre-natal care and delivery, if anything you should pay *more*
taxes.  Suppose we let your taxes stay at the same level.

Do you really think that funding for abortion would be reduced?  No, your
taxes would go towards other things, and more taxes from those who don't
object to paying for abortion would be moved from those other things to
pay for abortions.  All that happens is that the funds get shuffled around,
to give you a clear conscience.  Why put the government through all that
paperwork when the end result is no different?  Why worry about it when
it makes no difference and it doesn't hurt you in the least.

That is the most rediculous out-of-context analogy I have every heard.  I
do not advocate any such "advice".  There is quite a difference between
the illegal violation called "rape", and the constitutionally granted power
of taxation along with the funding of legal procedures.  If you can't see
the difference you can go to hell.

Your yanking followups to posts of mine (from other threads?) does not
demonstrate any deliberate lack of response on my part.  There is a great
deal of bandwidth on talk.abortion, and it can take a long time to get
through to the followups to articles I have posted, and many times responses
expire before I get to reading them.

It is pretty fucking arrogant of you to pull copies here and demand that
I respond to them here when they were posted already and quite possibly
responded to separately.  I believe I *have* indeed responded to some of
the following previously--though probably not each of them.

I have done so in the past.  It isn't my fault that you never saw it.

Here is a *brief* explanation.

A person has a right to do anything that does not interfere with the rights
of another person.  If you want to hear more about this aspect of "personity"
go read the thread "Why is bodily autonomy so important?" on talk.abortion.
You may have to look at all unexpired posts on that thread to find the post
where I give a fairly detailed explanation.  I believe it was posted on
April 18 or 19.

The second part is a definition of a person.  A simplistic explanation is
that a "person" is a member of society.  Most normal adult human beings are
good examples of "people".  Most children over two years old are "people" as
well.  The simple way of determining this is that you can have a conversation
with them.  It is actually more complicated than that, but I have no desire
to spend the time it would take to explain it to you.  Read the thread "Why
is bodily autonomy so important?" for more explanation and justification.

Actually, I was refering to the minority that objects to abortion, not

Do you have statistics that might answer this question?  Or are you just

If you disagree then give us some "reasons".  Given that abortion is
*LEGAL* and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the
population (or can you provide unbiased statistics?  I doubt you can
because I have never heard of an unbiased poll that has been conducted.)
...it is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford
them, who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you
would force upon them.  I refuse to pay *more taxes* to remove choice
from those women just because you object to a legal medical procedure.

More guns in society does not reduce the burden on the police;
it increases it.

Now this is rediculous.  Public transportation puts less of a burden on
transportation routes (roads, rails, etc) than private transportation.
It also puts a lesser burden on the environment.

Not "infants" you idiot.  Infants are born.

Who has a "right to life"?  People who have not violated other's rights,
have a "right to life".  A fetus is not a person.  You can not have a
conversation with them.  They are not biologically independent.  Their
awareness is questionable.  They have no experiences in the "real world"
to make up a personality.

There were some recent developments in the dispute about Masonry among
Southern Baptists.  I posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia, and
I suppose that it might be useful here.  Note that I do not necessarily
agree or disagree with any of what follows: I present it as information.

 *

For a short summary:  a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book
claiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity.
(Mr Holly's father rejects Christianity, and Mr Holly blames that on the
Masons.)

The SBC's Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department,
which studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ.  A few
years ago, they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry: they concluded
that it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality.
However, Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry, and
last year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry.  (I got the
feeling that they were saying "You got the wrong answer last time, try to
do better and get the answer we want.")

Anyway, there's been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, but
the dust has settled and the report is in.  Nobody is entirely happy with it,
but everybody seems willing to live with it.  Both sides are saying things
such as: "This was the best we were going to get in the current environment."

The report commends the Masons for the charity work they do, such as the
hospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help the
elderly and prevent drug abuse.  The report acknowledges that many well-
known Christians are and have been Masons, and notes that many teachings
of Masonry are "supportive of Christian faith and practice".  Examples of
the latter include belief in God, emphases on honesty and integrity, and
that some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs.

On the other hand, they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible
with Southern Baptist principles.  These included the use of titles which some
people consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though they
are not meant seriously), the "undeniably pagan and/or occultic" writings of
some Masonic leaders, the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation
can be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by many
Masonic lodges.  (I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole
aren't really in a place to speak on this last point.)


The report concludes that Masonry is not a religion, and says that membership
should not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals.
This was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges,
and while one may include elements strongly against Christianity, another may
not.  Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of
the believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probably
influenced how the report came out.

 *

The information above was gleaned from "The Religious Herald", a publication
of the Baptist General Association of Virginia, and "Baptists Today", which
does not have any direct links to a religious organisation.  (Autonomy is a
big issue among some Baptists.  8-)

Because I have neither the report itself, nor whatever Masonic documents are
relevant to these issues, none of the above comes with a guarantee.  Your
mileage may vary.  Void where prohibited.

   Francis Hitching is the author of, among other books,
_The Neck of the Giraffe_." He believes evolution is
directed by some sort of cosmic force, but does not like
Darwinism.  He wrote in this book [ _The Neck of the
Giraffe_, Ticknor & Fields, New Haven, Connecticut, 1982,
p. 12 (p. 4, paperback)] that:

   For all its acceptance in the scientific world as the
   great unifying principle of biology, Darwinism, after
   a century and a quarter, is in a surprising amount of
   trouble.  Evolution and Darwinism are often taken to
   mean the same thing.  But they don't.  Evolution of
   life over a very long period of time is a fact, if we
   are to believe evidence gathered during the last two
   centuries from geology, paleontology, molecular biol-
   ogy and many other scientific disciplines.  Despite
   the many believers in Divine creation who dispute this
   ..., the probability that evolution has occurred
   approaches certainty in scientific terms....  On the
   other hand Darwinism (or neo-Darwinism, its modern
   version) is a theory that seeks to explain evolution.
   It has not, contrary to general belief, and despite
   very great efforts, been proved.

   Research on Hitching turned up the following: Hitching is
basically a sensational TV script writer and has no scien-
tific credentials.  In _The Neck of the Giraffe_ he claimed
to be a member of the Royal Archaeological Institute, but an
inquiry to that institute said he was not.  He implied in
the "Acknowledgements" of _The Neck of the Giraffe_ that
paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould had helped in the writing
of the book, but upon inquiry Gould said he did not know him
and had no information about him.  Hitching also implied
that his book had been endorsed by Richard Dawkins, but upon
inquiry Dawkins stated: "I know nothing at all about Francis
Hitching.  If you are uncovering the fact that he is a char-
latan, good for you.  His book, _The Neck of the Giraffe,_
is one of the silliest and most ignorant I have read for
years."

   Hitching believes in the paranormal and has written on
Mayan pyramid energy and for some "In Search Of..." episodes
on BBC television.  The reference work _Contemporary
Authors,_ Vol. 103, page 208, lists him as a member of the
Society for Psychical Research, the British Society of
Dowsers and of the American Society of Dowsers.  His writ-
ings include: _Earth Magic,_ _Dowsing: The Psi Connection,_
_Mysterious World: An Atlas of the Unexplained,_ _Fraud,
Mischief, and the Supernatural_ and _Instead of Darwin_.

   Hitching's book spends much of its time attacking Dar-
winian evolution, borrowing heavily and uncritically from
young-earth creationist arguments.  Many of Hitching's "ref-
erences" are lifted from young-earth creationist literature
rather than being quoted directly from their original
sources.  One magazine had this to say [_Creation/Evolution
Newsletter_, 7, No. 5, pp. 15-16, September/October 1987]:

   Speaking of the Biblical Creation Society, there was
   an interesting letter in the January 1983 issue of
   their journal Biblical Creation (p. 74) concerning a
   review of Francis Hitching's 1982 book _The Neck of
   the Giraffe_.  Hitching's book is strongly anti-
   Darwinist, and is enthusiastically hailed by most cre-
   ationists (though he also pokes fun at fundamentalist
   creationists).  The letter, by creationist Malcolm
   Bowden (author of _The Rise of the Evolution Fraud_),
   points out that Hitching simply "culled his informa-
   tion from the creationist literature."  This is indeed
   the case:  many creationist works are cited favorably
   (Anderson, Coffin, Clark, Daly, Davidheiser, Dewar,
   Gish, Morris, Segraves, Whitcomb, and Wysong, plus
   various anti-Darwinists).  Hitching does cite Bowden's
   earlier book _Ape-Men -- Fact or Fallacy?_, but Bowden
   accuses Hitching of "lifting" several passages and
   illustrations from his book without acknowledgment:
   in other words, plagiarism.  "Hitchin's [sic] book is
   largely an exposition of the creationists [sic] view-
   point from the beginning to almost the end," Bowden
   points out....  Hitching is also a paranormalist, an
   advocate of psychic evolution.... [Hitching's book]
   _Earth Magic_ is a wild, extremely entertaining and
   thoroughly psychic interpretation of megalithic struc-
   tures....  Hitching also includes in his scheme cosmic
   cataclysms, Atlantis, pyramidology, dowsing, ESP,
   miraculous healing, and astrology.

If that was really what the FBI said, I'm extrelemy suspicious: They
_knew_ the Branch Davidian was a very paranoid group. To say, "...or
you will be gassed" would probably have been understood as _poison_
gas, not tear gas. If the FBI made that remark, I'd say they were

MAGI: 

[Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting
 ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous
 _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which
 most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the
 second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of
 the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi
 to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]

  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain 
etymology. It may originally have meant "member of the tribe," as in the
Avestan compound mogu-tbish ("hostile to a member of the tribe"). This meaning
would have been further resticted, among the Medes, to "member of the priestly
tribe" and perhaps to "priest" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is
probably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the "Magoi" as one of
the six tribes of the Medes.
  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a
priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were
responsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their
knowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median
priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median
monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century
through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the
Great (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political
and civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced
concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period
(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is
demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by
Darius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by
Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of
the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.
  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the
sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the
possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be
attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.
  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi
are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of
the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is
untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the
Avestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, "gift"), is
not without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,
in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of
purity, or separation of the "mixture" of the two opposed principles of spirit
and matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as "chorus," from
the root mangh, which is said to mean "sing the magic song" (Nyberg, 1966) and
has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an
ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though
there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms
magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the
Avestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite
a recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore
the Avestan term for "priest," athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is 
perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis 
(Gershevitch, 1964).
  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the
Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in
particular derives from an older form, magupati ("head of the Magi"). During
the Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of
a hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad ("the high priest of
high priests") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical
hierarchy.
  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,
khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of
the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.
The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons
of putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian
community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the
Parsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this
rite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was
in vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with
wax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples
of Central Asia.
  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to
offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a
ritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the
custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the
relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was
called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also
known for the practice of killing harmful, or "Ahrimanical," animals (khrafstra)
such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,
tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of
felt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose
and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their
breath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition
that is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was
that of the priesthood: white.
  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in
possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they
gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of
professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally
inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been
jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this
they were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible
for teaching the prince the "magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes" and thus
the "cult of the gods." Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with
the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and
master of himself.
  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great
influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite
several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of
Gaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself
Smerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -
the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,
in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed
as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.
  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were
renowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of
the greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men
who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in
Bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were
also known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;
this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,
like "goes," "expert in the magic arts" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the
Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and
had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.
  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it
is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called
western Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must
have been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the
Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in
contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in
varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.
  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their
varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical
historians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their
customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,
belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology
and eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi
even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the
Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted
Zoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and
placed themselves under his venerable name.
  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the
eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those
elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite
often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the
Zoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, "the law-abjuring
daivas"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of
texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and
practices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first
chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the
supreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;
Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of
all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the
land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it
has been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the
absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own
priesthood, would be very strange.
  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the
corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the
first millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute
directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to
us especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of
the ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles
of the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu ("beneficent
spirit") and Angra Mainyu ("hostile spirit") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra
Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-
formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-
astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the
Mesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known
to the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can
see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which
we give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]
  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously
important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in
the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their
natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of
Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began
to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,
Hermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises
on the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have
survived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of
wisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority
of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an
abundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).
  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting
ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous
_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which
most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the
second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of
the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi
to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]
  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the
religious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,
1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of
Iran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to
establish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an
orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures
in the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar
and Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.

SAOSHYANT:
  The Avestan term saoshyant ("future benefactor"; MPers., soshans) designates
the savior of the world, who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind.
The concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro-
astrianism, together with that of dualism; it appears as early as in the Gathas.
Zarathushtra (Zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a Sao-
shyant, one who performs his works for the Frashokereti, the end of the present
state of the world, when existence will be "rehabilitated" and "made splendid."
[See Frashokereti]
  Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological
myth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three. All the saviors
are born from the seed of Zarathushtra, which is preserved through the ages in
Lake Kansaoya (identified with present-day Lake Helmand, in Seistan, Iran),
protected by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. The greatest of the awaited
Saoshyants, the victorious Astvatereta ("he who embodies truth"), the son of
the Vispataurvairi ("she who conquers all"), is the third, who will make
existence splendid; he appears in Yashts 19. Upon his arrival humankind will
no longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be granted
unlimited power. At that time the dead will be resurrected, and the living will
be immortal and indestructable. Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the
powerful enemies of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and
of asha), Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and
render it imperishable. He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with
the forces of evil, which will be destroyed.
  The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation
(Kellens, 1974), as are those of his two brothers, Ukhshyatereta, "he who makes
truth grow," and Ukhshyatnemah, "he who makes reverence grow"; the names of the
three virgins (Yashts 13) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra
when they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants, are equally
speculative. Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a
millennium, initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence; Astvatereta will
appear in the third and final millennium to save mankind.
  The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid
period (sixth to fourth century BCE). It was not, perhaps the principal element
in the formation of the messianic idea, but it was certainly a determining
factor, one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the
confines of the Iranian world. A similar concept, that of the future Buddha,
Maitreya, was most likely indebted to it, and Christian messianism can trace
its roots to the same source.

the word of Jesus? If you don't follow the morality of the Ten
Commandments and the Law and the Prophets and the word of Jesus, whose
morality do you follow?

	Is this Zeno's Paradox? Nothing can get out of a black hole because
the escape velocity is the speed of light. I don't know how time dialation
can prevent matter spiraling in from getting to the event horizon. Can any-
one explain how matter gets in.

	I hope that it was clear that a black hole can lose mass to its
surroundings via the so-called Hawking rediation. This is the idea that
virtual partical pairs can form so close to the event horizen that one
of the pair is trapped and the other goes free. The conservation of
energy requires that the black hole lose mass, albeit very slowly, that
that if primordial black holes were formed, the ones about the size of
small asteriods should be evaporating about now in the history of our
universe. The story goes that we should be able to see the flashes caused
by the explosions that result at the end of these black holes. Does this
idea still hold promise, or has it been debunked.

I like it.  Short.  To the point.  Made for Hollywood.  This makes a hell

I don't accept atoms or gravity as fact either.  They are extremely useful
mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make.
Other posters have aptly explained the atomic model.  Gravity, too, is
very much a theory; no gravity waves have even been detected, but we
have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on
objects by this thing we _call_ gravity.  Gravity, however, is _not_ 
a fact.  It is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects 
behave in our physical environment.  Newton thought gravity was a
simple vector force; Einstein a wave. Both are very useful models that 
have no religious overtones or requirements of faith, unless of course you 
want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly 
the way the theory now formulated talks about it.  That takes a great 
leap of faith, which, of course, is what religion takes.  Evolution
is no different.

[...stuff deleted...]

There's a very good reason for it.  The insurance industry sets it's premiums
through a spread-the-cost-of-risk approach.  (Yes, even though 
non-smokers pay less, they still pay more than if there were no smokers 
at all.  And smokers pay for CEO quadruple bypass operations.  And it
just goes on and on.)  Insurance is capitalist-socialism at its very best.
And if you don't like it, you're only choice right now is not to 
participate at all, else start up your very own firm that ignores the 
risks you don't like.

	Has anyone asked themselves these questions:

	1)  Have you seen the ENTIRE video sequences taken during the
	  opening rounds?  I seem to recall missing several key parts:
		a)  The first five minutes of day one; only the shooting
		  part comes out.
		b)  What happened to the Feds video units?  You mean they do
		  not carry helmet cams?  Wonder why not?
	2)   How is it you can have camera crews with live transmission

		a)  You realize the units carry ittle bitty 8mm backups?

		b)  Until all views are seen, it is premature to point

	25 children dead.  If anyone thinks blaming Koresh -- or the BATF
	helps this any at all, is sick.  and wrong.

		The reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely
		straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences

		The BATF agentss are more concerned with their repuations
		and morals ("not my fault, Koresh did it!") than they
		are with:

			25 dead children.

	Same goes for Koresh & his followers - who are all (mostly) dead.

For those who like contrary questions:

	of an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass:

		innocent until proven guilty.
	not
		innocent until presumed guilty.

	1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.

		Don't tell me they do not exist.  They are standard
		equipment.

	2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?

		a)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This
		  aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable
		  as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.

			.... gotcha!

		  ... when in isolation from other substances.

		  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote
		  launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce "this window,
		  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come
		  down", and maintain a left to right sequence?

		b)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when
		  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)
		  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to
		  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long
		  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend
		  to ignite.

			What other chemicals come up in the forensics?
			Who else will be allowed to test the site?

		c)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation
		  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made
		  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature
		  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain
		  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length
		  of time (start a wall fire and wait).

			Check your military records; look at the tapes.
			Why were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),
			tear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why
			the hurry. was there still a comm channel open
			to the outside?).

			Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the
			compound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones
			are missing?

	Do I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.
	You trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?
		IN advance of a Court?  God help us.
			(For we are surely not helping ourselves).
	You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?

		You are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.
		Look again.

	Did it happen that way?  I do not know.  I was not there.
		AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE.
	But will that happen?  89 people will NOT have the chance
		to tell their side as the BATF leader was, on camera.

No one wins.  Except:  more force next time.

	Listen to your hearts, people.

Thanx again Stephen.

                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^
	Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram
were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over
who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like
Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider
Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make
no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  The
thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed
down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only
entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have
been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The
Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help
here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.
Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited
for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other
claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)

	Both sects practiced the "1-year food stockpile" doctrine,
and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at
least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a
militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than
face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a
great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite
justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,
this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people
had nobody to turn to save themselves.

	Just a little context to put this all in perspective.

	The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS
and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts
from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.  At no time have
I ever even heard this hinted at.  I'm taking it with a salt block.

	If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS
philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true
Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his
own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may
as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You
can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected
it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to
Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they
will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover
liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade
alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.
These people are the "salt of the Earth" and as such are more
easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.

	That's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects have
splinter groups that don't mirror the masses, but these are small
and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry.

	None of this has any relevance to guns, though.  When a
man's religion is used to deny him the right of self-protection with
the weapons suitable for the job, he'll find an ally in me.

	Not so, Arnie.  You forget repeating arms (which include machine
guns, gatling-style guns, etc...), cannon, rifles, and let's not forget
the bullets they managed to use.  Everything from rocks to lead to
a couple iron balls with a chain between them.  If you think warfare
is brutal today, buddy you have no idea how brutal things can get.

Y'know, when the right to bear arms was "invented", all we had to worry
about was the shotgun and pistol. Now, we have to worry about drive-bys
with Uzis sparaying the entire neighborhood with bullets.

Just because someting was good once, does not mean it will be forever.

Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe that Christians are required to observe
the Sabbath, whether it is on Saturday or Sunday.  The Sabbath was part
of a Covenent between God and the Israelites and is not required for
Christians.

Sorry, but it doesn't matter what _you_ think, I am a Christian, who happens to
belong to the LDS Church.  [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints].

I don't usually read t.r.m.  It is truly informative to stop by, and see that there
are still people in the world like those that forced my ancestors into the deserts
of Utah, and then out of the country entirely.  (My grandmother was born in Mexico,
where her family had moved to escape religious persecution in the US).  I'm willing
to admit that members of other churches are Christians, if they believe in Christ and
(try to) follow his teachings, even though they have different interpretations of 
the bible.  And yet these other churches often go out of their way to define whether
or not I am considered to be Christian.  Could someone mail me a set of rules/beliefs
that must be followed to be a Christian?  Does this set of rules exclude other large
bodies of believers?  

I know, this is a waste of everyone's time, this has probably been discussed N times,
etc.  I guess I'm more sensitive to this 'demonization' after what went on in Texas.

If I have a habit that I really want to break, and I am willing to
make whatever sacrifice I need to make to break it, then I do so.
There have been bad habits of mine that I've decided to put forth the
effort to break, and I've done so; there have been other bad habits
that I've decided are not worth the effort to break.  It's my choice,
either way.

I am my own master.  I choose what I want to do.  I weigh the benefits
of my actions against their consequences, and I use my experience to
help me deal with the unexpected, which in turn make me more experienced.

I don't always succeed, but I never fail, either -- I learn.

Do *you* have any habits you can't break?  Why not?

>For one, you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand
>even the slightest concept of the Bible.

I have arrived at my own understanding of Christianity, just as you've
probably arrived at your own understanding of Islam that is most
likely very different from the way a Moslem thinks of his religion.
Are you "unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the
slightest concept of the Quran"?  If that's different, then how is it
different from what you accuse me of?  Can I accuse you of having no
desire to understand even the slightest concept of atheism?

>How about sexual sins?  Gotta any of those secret desires

Of COURSE not.  That's disgusting.  For centuries, religions have been
discriminating on sex and treating women as second-class humans;
that's one of the reasons I renounced my Christianity.

>Do you insult

No.  I don't insult people.  Period.  It's not in my nature, and it's
not something that I want to do, either.

>Are you truly the master of yourself?

Not yet -- but my life is the ground I use to practice on.  The fun is
in the getting there!

We don't start out perfect; we've got to strive to be something
better.  I know my shortcomings, and I know my strengths, and I live
my life according to the decisions I make, and I am content to abide
with the consequences of my decisions as easily as I'll accept the
praise for them.  There have been times in my life when I've made
mistakes, yes; I try to never make the same mistake twice.

I regard Christ as a myth.  I feel that there are far too many people
offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and
did.  The only person who can really judge me is *me*.  I choose the
roads I travel, and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of
any given road or turn back -- and as long as I don't *always* turn
back, there's no shame in it.  When I need help, I seek out my friends.

And you don't have a clue about what I'm saying, either.  Open your

empty words.  This is my LIFE, this is what gives me MEANING.

Huh?  You're going WAY off the track here.

I say my mother loves me.  How do I know, you ask?  I can point to
definite things she's done for me, and I can even just bring her to
you so you can ask her, face-to-face.

You say your deity loves you.  How do you know, I ask?  You can't even
convince me that it exists!

If any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot, promising untold
pleasures to me if I'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my
rationality for just this once, then I would choose 'hell'.  I can
*not* lie to myself to placate another being, no matter how powerful
it is.

Note also that there are several gods trying to lure me this way:
Yahweh, Allah, Zeus, Odin, Ra...  Please give me a solid reason to
choose one of them over the others.

That paragraph demonstrates that you haven't listened to a single word
I've said.

Have you ever gone to an amusement park?  Why?  I mean, after a few
hours, it closes, and nothing's different except that you're a few
dollars lighter.  Going to the amusement park doesn't do you any good
at all.  Why do you do such a meaningless thing?

The answer is that you think it's fun.  You play the skee-ball over
and over because you'd like to get better at it, even though you're
not going to win anything better than a stuffed animal even if you
blow ten dollars on it.  You ride the roller coaster because it's an
thrilling experience, even though (because?) it scares the dickens out
of you.

In the same way, I think life is fun.  And I don't intend to leave the
amusement park of life until they close down for the night!  :-D

So you (and your holy book) say.  By the same token, therefore, Santa

believe that what you say is true.  Please give me some reason that I
can't similarly apply to Santa Claus.

I can't do it, because your existence means nothing more to me than
just your communications over the net.  You have no more bearing on
nor importance in my life than that; remove it, and you will cease to
be significant to me.

Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a
collection of verses in a book, and cannot be supported without
invoking them?

Or do you mean that the existence of your deity (and, in fact, any
other deity that can be written about) is as real as your own
existence?

Why do you believe what you believe?

What are the consequences of the homophobic ranting of the
self-righteous?  Well, I just noted this on another group,
and thought I'd pass it along.  The context is talk.origins,
and a report of yet another "debate" that was nothing but an
attempt at mindless bullying and factless assertion by a
standard-issue Creationist.  The writer reflects that the
behavior reported reminds him of some Christian groups he has
known.  I believe that the writer is a (non-homosexual) Christian:

+	There is a very effective technique used to promote
+	unit cohesion among the Soldiers of the Lord.  It is
+	called "witnessing"...  I've seen this process used well
+	and poorly; the near devil worship I mention was a group 
+	... that was using the witnessing to get people lathered
+	up to go kill homosexuals or at least terrorize them off 
+	campus as it was clearly God's will that they do so.

I have deleted the specifics of the location, as I do not
believe it characteristic of the place (a state in which I
spent my formative first 10 years), though it *does* have,
unfortunately, a subpopulation that this remark fits to a tee.

Aside from the fact that you will be flamed up one side and down the other
for suggesting that the RKBA was "invented" rather than merely recognized,
your assertion merely reinforces the knowledge that RKBA must be maintained
so that we, the People, can protect our own neighborhoods.  The police
certainly aren't doing it.  How long did it take the DC police to catch
that drive-by shotgunner (note that he wasn't using an Uzi, but one of
those shotguns you claim we needed to worry about back then)?  I believe
there were eleven attacks before the police ever caught a suspect....

This is simply complete nonsense. The basis for 'matters of fact' is,
if any class of opinion, the majority of INFORMED popular opinion
for some value of informed. I would really hate to base my knowledge
of, for instance, QM on what the overwhelming popular opinion is.

Opinions about 'raw facts' as you call them are somewhat different
than interpretations of those raw facts.

That might seem like a good first pass guess, but it turns out to
be a pretty cruddy way to look at things, because we all seem to
have rather different opinions (experiences) about what is good
and evil, while we seem to be able to agree on what the meter says.

See above. We can't seem to agree on what's better.

I don't see that it's any evidence at all.
As I point out above, I'm really not interested very much in
what the popular opinion is. I'm prepared to trust--to some extent--
the popular opinion about direct matters of physical observation
because by and large they accord with my own. However, if everyone
else said the dial read 1.5 and it looked like a 3 to me, I would
hope that I would believe myself. I.e. believing other people about
these matters seems to have a reasonable probability of predicting
what I would believe if I observed myself, but the possibility exists
that it is not. Since I know from observation that others disagree
with me about what is good, I believe I can discount popular opinion
about 'good' from the beginning as a predictor of my opinion.
I would say that the fact that it seems almost impossible to get
people to agree on what is good in a really large number of situations
is probably the best evidence that objective morality is bogus, actually.

Perhaps true, but I didn't make assertions about what you believed.

Are you serious?  Two statements, one of which says that use of force
in the given situation is moral, and the other of which says it is
not moral "say effectively the same thing?"

Would you say this of any two statements, one saying "X is moral" and
the other saying "X is immoral?"   How would you decided when two 
statements "X is moral" "X is immoral" actually conflict, and when
they "say effectively the same thing".

They might lead you to do the same thing, but the difference is what
motivates pacifism so they obviously don't lead pacifists to to the
same thing.

Now I'll raise the issue again in connection with Mr O'Dwyer's use
of the word "plausible".

I can plause all kinds of cases, for example: in which people 
actually own land, but don't know that, and so are willing to "sell" 
it in play for derisory sums, only to find that they sold it for
real.   Cases in which their mental capacity is imnpaired.   Cases
in which they err about the true value of what they are selling.

Pretty soon you have to start talking about "informed owner"
"competent owner" "educated owner" and so on, and the concept
gets less and less clear and exceptions more and more plausible.

But the real problem remains that of looking only at end-points
in a context.    Maybe most of us will agree with you that a pebble 
is "small" and that the Moon is "big", but that does not mean that
you have an objective measuring scale.   Only that these two are 
fairly common opinions *in context*.

An astronomer may claim that the Moon is actually "tiny" and
a micro-biologist may remark that a pebble is "huge".   Similarly,
if an armed Serbian offers a helpless Bosnian a dollar and his 
life for his land, rather than killing him and taking it for free, 
the Bosnian may consider that he is getting quite a good deal.

Kermit Tensmeyer quoted from a few sources and then wrote something.
I will attempt to construct a facsimile of what was previously said, and 
then address Kermit's offering.

John Redelfs originally wrote...

     I respond.

     The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise
     before entering into heaven. No one has made a point for or against 
     that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox
     belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16), 
     the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).

     The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent
     on their death bed. Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was
     contradictory to what John's position put forward. The thief on the 
     cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of 
     the righteous dead. John's position possibly needs to be reworked.
     Kermit needs to address the topic at hand.

Well, if they were Satanists, or followers of an obscure religion,
then I would be sure that Christians would in unison condemn and 
make this to a show case. But when we are dealing with a fanatical
Revelation preacher that kills ultimately everyone, including the
innocent children, then it seems that we are dealing with Christians 
and christians (note the spelling).

And does not this show the dangers with religion -- in order 
word a mind virus that will make mothers capable of letting
their small children burn to ashes while they scream?

Well, looking at the videos it seems that this fire started in various
places at the same time, which would indicate that this was a planned
action. I'm sure FBI and BATF didn't *deliberately* start a possible
fire, having a sniper kill Korresh would have been a far easier 
method. Looking at the careful operation, and use of tear gas
that as I know don't start fires, it is less likely that this 
was the case.

Sorry, but my bets are on fanatical people keen to start
Armageddon -- theirs.

There's another point to be made. Those who have been inside burning
houses know that if they want to stay alive, it's better to run out
from the building. We had one case where an FBI agent *had to 
drag out a women* from the burning house, she run back in when
she saw the forces arriving. It is a good indication of the fanatical
mind that the followers had -- including having they children burned
instead of saving these innocent victims of the instance.

The interesting notion is that (I watched TV tonight) Koresh never
claimed officially to be Jesus Christ. His believers hoped that 
he would be, but he never took this standpoint himself.

He was more interested in breaking the seven seals of Revelation,
and make sure that Armageddon would start. Well it did, and 19
children died, and no God saved them.

Christians through ages have had to learn to be patient. I do think
it's time to face the reality. The events during the last 52 two
days showed what the world is really like.

If anyone is interested in the history of AMORC, I do think Spencer
Lewis published books about the beginning and his mission. The 
Alexandria bookstore (that's the name of the book store operated 
by AMORC) should have a selection that should provide the interested
reader more insight).

DROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 3

   		 NINETEENTH LETTER  

		 MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI 
A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW, Part 3       

(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 2)

   THIRD SIGN:  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW)
are extremely varied.  Because his messengership is
universal, he has been distinguished by  miracles that
relate to almost all species of creation.
    Just as the supreme aide of a renowned ruler, arriving
with many gifts in a city where various people live, will be
welcomed by a representative of each people who
acclaims him and bids him welcome in his own language
so, too, when the supreme messenger of the Monarch of
Pre- and  Post-Eternity  (Ezel and Ebed  Sultani) honored the
universe by coming as an envoy to the inhabitants of the
earth, and brought with him the light of truth and spiritual
gifts sent by the Creator of the universe and derived from
the realities of the whole universe, each species of
creation -from water, rocks, trees, animals and human
beings to the moon, sun and stars- welcomed him and
acclaimed his prophethood, each in its own language, and
each bearing one of his miracles.
    Now it would require a voluminous work to mention all
his miracles.  As the punctilious scholars have written
many volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood,
here we will briefly point out only the general category
into which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted
as accurate reports.
    The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad
(SAW) fall into two main categories:  

    The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal 
events that happened at the time of his birth, or before his 
declaration of prophethood.  

    The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences 
of the prophethood, and contains two subdivisions: 

    1) Those wonders that were manifested after
his departure from this world in order to confirm his
prophethood, and 
	2) Those that he exhibited during the era
of his prophethood.  The latter has also two parts:  
	2.1) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest
in his own personality, his inner and outer being, his moral
conduct and perfection, and 
    2.2) The miracles that: related to substantial matters.  
The last part again has two branches:  
	2.2.1) Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality, and 
	2.2.2) Those relating to matter and creation.  This last 
branch is again divided into two categories:  
	2.2.2.1) The first involves the paranormal happenings 
that occured during his mission either to break the 
stubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment the
faith of the belivers.  This category has twenty different
sorts, such as the splitting of the moon, the flowing of
water from the fingers, the satisfying of large numbers with
a little food, and the speaking of trees, rocks and animals
Each of these sons has also many instances, and thus
has, in meaning, the strength of confirmation by
consensus.  
	2.2.2.2)  As for the second category, this
includes events lying in the future that occured as he had
predicted upon Allah (SWT)'s instructions.  Now starting
from the last category, we will summarize a list of them.(1)

(1) Unfonunately, I could not write as I had intended
without choice, I wrote as my head dictated, and I could
not completely conform to the order of this classification.

Hence we are "all" above the Law where "all" in this case refers to
Christians.

When was the last time you heard about a Jewish animal sacrifice?

The blood sacrifice of an innocent man?

Then why don't Christians follow it, why don't they even follow their

No it doesn't.  Check again in any of the popular GR texts (Misner,
Thorne, and Wheeler, for example).  It takes a finite proper time for
anything near the horizon to cross it (if it's going to in the first
place), and a finite proper time for anything crossing the horizon to
reach r=0.

Yes, when you tag on the "Unfortunately, ...", then to all intents and
purposes you are saying the same thing.

#Would you say this of any two statements, one saying "X is moral" and
#the other saying "X is immoral?"   How would you decided when two

That's not true.  You could formulate a pragmatic belief in minimum 
force and still be a pacifist.  If the minimum is 0, great  - but one is
always trying to get as close to 0 force as possible under that belief.
Not the same as 'force is immoral, period', but still tending to pacifism.

There is a rite like this described in Joseph Campbell's
_Occidental_Mythology_.  He also described levels of initiation, I think
6?  I don't know where Campbell got his info, but I remember thinking he
was being a little eclectic.

Quite a bit.  If you haven't read Campbell, give him a try.

Barp!   Logic alert!  Just because the modern theory of evolution is, in the
view of Francis Hitching (please provide a date for that reference) highly

	Do you believe in absolute morality? And do you have absolute
knowledge? Mere mortal you? And if you claim that your God has absolute
knowledge, then you have have absolute knowledge of that?

	If you read the Bible and claim that it is the Word of God, and
in it is contained the absolute moral code you ascribe to, but the prophets,
no matter how divinely inspired are not gods but mere fallable mortals,
then how can you be absolutely sure that they having heard the Word of
God, have got it right? Also, you read their words in translation which
invariably introduces errors of nuance and usage, and then how do you
know that you got the right message? I assert that you do not, and that
you do not have absolute knowledge of anything, including absolute morals.

	The only way you can assert such things is through appeal to
prejudice via appeal by force of authority through yourself or a group
you have aligned yourself to.

>If morals come from what is societally accepted, why follow that? 

	Because social pressure is the most powerful force known to
man. How can you disprove a contention that the richeousness of
established religion is anything other than social convention? One
way is to assert that there are moral universals. But that is not
the same thing as asserting that these universials owe their origen
to trancendance or the supernatural or to dieties.

>What right do
>we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality?

	We expect empathy from our fellow man. We expect to raise each
generation with values that we live by, those which assure that mistakes
we have made are not repeated. Do you think that mere authority checks
all tendancies which are disruptive of civilized life? I think not! In fact
authority is power, and power corrupts. The most powerful tend to think
that they are above the law that applies to everybody else. Religious
authority, theocarcy, has not mitigated this any better than other
power structures on this score and it seems that because there are no
checks on power concentrated in clergy or nobility that the abuses
recorded by history are greater.

	We live and teach morals by setting an example, starting in
the home. This does not come from books or authority figures in
soceity. If people are weak or confused at the present time it is
not because the breakup of the family has been precipitated by some
mysterious moral decidance that redidication to traditional formulas
will repair. That is but magical and simplistic thinking. We need to
look at forces in the way we live, even the good things that happen
in our present culture, that are weakening the family as the primary
means we have to teach children values. Of course people are trying
to have the community do things that once were done in the family
alone. This may not be as effective. We need to look at this.

>Pardon the extremism, but couldn't I murder your "brother" and say
> that I was 
>exercising my rights as I saw them, was doing what felt good, didn't want
>anyone forcing their morality on me, or I don't follow your "morality" ?

	Laying down the law, and with teeth, doesn't stop the crazy
man from murdering your brother despite the morality or the law. It
may help you with dealing promptly with him after the fact, but it
may not be very effective for preventing mental illness or cracy people
from murduring.

	It is quite interesting how ineffective moral authoritarianism
is in fact. It may work best in societies that are already sonmewhat
isolated, that do not experience change, and have long standing
traditions. In a basic way moral codes decrease the number of decisions
people have to make everyday. In a real sense thay allow people to not
have to think. That is OK when things are stable, but it becomes a
problem when conditions change. This leads me to think that morals are
not sumething fundemental, at least most of them, recalling that there
are values all people seem to agree on, but mutate in response to outside
political, economic, technical, and cultural influiences.

	Lately, I have come to regard people who speak like you
with great suspicion, especially when they include the pharse "for
the children.". I think that such people are more of an imparative to
want to  control what others do and think than other more nobil pursuits,
such as of the truth.

So we have this highly Christian religious order that put fire
on their house, killing most of the people inside.

I'm not that annoyed about the adults, they knew supposedly what
they were doing, and it's their own actions.

What I mostly are angry about is the fact that the people inside,
including mothers, let the children suffer and die during awful
conditions.

If this is considered religious following to the end, I'm proud
that I don't follow such fanatical and non-compassionate religions.

You might want to die for whatever purpose, but please spare
the innocent young ones that has nothing to do with this all.

I have a hard time just now understanding that Christianity
knows about the word compassion. Christians, do you think 
the actions today would produce a good picture of your 
religion?

Jesus certainly demonstrated the great depth of his love for the
children who died today at the Davidian complex.

Sorry, but the events today made me even more negative concering
organized religion.

        ^^^ "center of the hole" where the evil singularity lurks

There is NO singularity at the horizon.  The appearance that there is one
comes from attempting to use a coordinate system that doesn't map properly
(physically) in this geometry, rather analogous to the "singularity" at
the North and South Poles of the Earth when using Latitude and Longitude
lines.  Such "singular" behavior as the earlier post suggested (infinite
time to reach the horizon) is a mathematical artifact of the wrong choice
of coordinates.  As Paul says, in the object's frame of reference,
it WILL hit the horizon in finite time, and then plunge to the singularity
(that IS a "real" singularity) in a (short, for "small" holes) further finite 
amount of time.

Not only that, but to an OUTSIDE observer, an object that falls into a black
hole disappears in a finite time also, in spite of the relativistic "slow-
down" that intuition suggests.  This is because any light emitted by the
object as it falls (or is shone onto it by a separate "flashlight") consists
of individual, FINITE quanta, and only a finite number of these can reach
the object before it plunges through the horizon.  These will be succesively
more red-shifted, true, but only a finite number of them will hit the object,
and following ones will be too late to interact with the object until they,
too, are inside the horizon (and thus cannot come out).

This reddening, dimming and disappearance is exponentially fast, as the object 
approaches the horizon, when you do the math.

As Paul says, this is discussed in Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler's book 
"Gravity" where they talk about the appropriatness (sp?) of the term "black 
hole" and the inappropriatness (sp?) of an older term: "frozen star", which 
was used earlier in this century before all the implications of black-hole 
theory were understood.  Do not let the math deter you from looking at this 
book; it's got a lot of good prose discussions of this material, in between 
the equations, that is VERY good reading, IMHO.

Of course, it's all just THEORY... :-)

Perhaps the major difference here is that we notice something, which we call
gravity, and then do some modelling around it.  I myself do not notice any
deity.  Hence a model cannot be made.  A deity is an abstract, and hence
religion may be considered a model of an abstract.

Besides, we can always change the model of gravity if the one we have doesn't
work too well.  Can you imagine this with the bible?  Erm, excuse me, I bought
this about 1500 years ago and it doesn't seem quite right...can I have an
improved model please?!

It's only been happening to the Mormons for... what? 150 years?

I've been reading these posts for a while and I still can't figure out
what is so terrible about just having an opinion. You seem to imply that
admitted your opinion is an opinion precludes you from justifying it or
convincing others of its worth -- ridiculous!

Evidently Jim thinks I am arguing an `existence' issue.  It should be clear 
from my response to Bill Rawlins above that in this thread I am objecting only 
to the use of Josephus to validate the messiah claim.  The argument against the
messiah claim is not weak (maybe mine is, but in the hands of pros it is not).

There are indeed two passages.  The short one *cannot be used* to validate the
messiah claim, imo.  That's why I refered to the long, which can be used.  It 
flatly states Jesus "was the Christ", and mentions the crucifixion, 
resurrection and Christian belief in said claims.

The short entry mentions Jesus in passing as James' brother - "... brother of
Jesus, who *was called* the Christ, .... [emphasis mine]", and that's it. 
If original, Josephus has merely reported what some people say.  It is nothing 
more than an observation, one which lacks the Christian fundamentals.

The long is widely regarded as an insert for three reasons: 1) its way out of
context, 2) Origen evidently knew nothing of it, and 3) its rather inconsistent
with the short.  There is consensus among scholars as defined on the long as 
insert, and I see Jim agrees.  Consensus is usually reflected subtly, as in
Elaine Pagel's _Gnostic Gospels_ (p. 85), "A comment *attributed* to Josephus
reports ....[emphasis mine]".  As for #2, I mentioned in my original post that 
the long is a 3rd century insert (more properly, post-Origen as Jim notes).

There may not be consensus on the short.  The text, which discusses James in a
legal role, stands with or without it.  That it does not upset context makes it
difficult to argue insert.  On the other hand, an in-passing insert is easily
disguised in any context.  Nonetheless, on historiographical grounds it is 
worthless for the messiah defense, and that's why I didn't mention it. 

I don't know about the Arabic ms.  If you have a translation reference, Jim,
please let me know.  As for its "much less gung-ho" tone, obviously the date 
of this ms. is critical.  If after ca. AD 700, a watered-down entry in lieu 
of removal can be easily explained.

Dear Rob,

>the truth.  When I read your response here, I see condescension.  When you
>reply to a post, reply to the post you quote.  This statement undermines
>any good points you might have had (it was enough to make me stop reading).

Sometimes I do come across condesending, and I am sorry I come across that
way at times.  Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll
try to get better.

Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle
approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,
only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both
cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse
for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.

Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. 
vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is
an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  
I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with
his set of excuses.  

I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants
to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses
which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the
Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being
sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.

From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man
standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I 
see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away
from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see
the dialog:


Me:  "Brian K, please step aside before you get run over." 

BK:  "There is no truck."

Me:  "Turn around at look."

BK:  "No."

Me:  "Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at
     the oncoming truck."

BK:  "No. Explain to me why trucks exist."

Me:  "Turn around or you will run over."

BK:  "No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday."

Me:  "You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing
      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life."
      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.

BK:  "It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.
      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me."
      And by the way, I really have an open mind."


So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   

I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not
billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people
fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.
I can now see the truck behind Brian.

My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the
truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out
of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself
to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if
he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that
to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,
Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he
does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his
head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is
satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. 

Thank you again Rob for your reproach.  I really do appreciate it.  (My
wife tells me the same thing at times.)   :-)   I will try to do better.

My apologies. I really didn't have the time to chase down a slew of
references from 10-20 years ago when I was looking at these issues.
>The mother church of Jerusalem disappeared when the Romans took the city.
>Despite some pious legends, the evidence seems to be that the members of

1. The mother church did disappear at the time of the Roman attack. James
the Just was judicially murdered a few years earlier, but there is
evidence that the church survived him. There is no evidence that it still
existed after the assault on the city. The individuals historically
associated with that church disappear at that time. 

2. The followers of Jesus included a number of individuals whose nicknames
suggested connections with the Jewish terrorism of the time (Zealotes,
Iscariot, "Sons of Thunder").

3. For cult psychology, there's an extensive literature.

4. For an understanding of the motivation of the members of the Jerusalem
church, there is a mixed collection of sources. The Anchor Bible has some
interesting articles, but one thing I've noticed about biblical
scholarship is that intellectual honesty and a skeptical approach are
notably lacking. You basically have to spread your net wide and then
winnow. (For example, Allegro and Schoenfeld have some interesting ideas,
but they were both "over the top.") Many interesting ideas have not been
followed up, mostly due to religious reasons. What was the connection of
early Christian theology to Samaritan dualism and proto-gnosticism? (See
Stephen's speech in Acts for a Samaritan interpretation of the
crucifixion.) Schweitzer's interpretation of Jesus's motivations could be
updated, especially now that we have the Essene and Chenoboskian
materials. And so it goes. (For instance, the convincing statistical
evidence concerning the authorship of the Pauline materials has been
completely ignored by biblical scholars.)

I don't track this area much any more. (My coursework is 20 years old.) I
have a personal theory that the synoptics were written in Syria during the
course of the Jewish Revolt. I suspect Mark was written before the fall of
Jerusalem as an apology to get the Romans and Roman-sympathizers off the
back of the local Greek Christians. Matthew and Luke were written with
similar goals, but incorporating additional materials. Given the evidence
in the Gospel of Thomas (Chenoboskien), I suspect Q came from a Samaritan
(proto-gnostic) milieu. In any case, they were written in an environment
cut off by time or circumstances from Jerusalem, not expecting further
contact, and not wanting to be connected by outsiders to the themes of the
doctrines held by the Jerusalem church.

Sorry about the lack of documentation, but the time is hard to find.

The Amendment in question was "invented" so that a government that had it in mind to

Peter wrote a bit of the Bible.  What Peter says about God is what
the Bible says.   


Consider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands of
years, various people come up and testify of their experience with the
living God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses,
once the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes
David, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King 
Nebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes
Nehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent
takes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use
to kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up
comes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself.
Up comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS
agents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years
with people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself
"I am." 

While you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that
King David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known
Matthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these
people are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet
all of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells
of his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is
different, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly
reveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God.
What Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of
Babylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different
perspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony
dares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness's
testimony, even though different from those prior, consistently
describes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.  

Now.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic
on the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  "I am".  He has
revealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58).
Please believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.

Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? 
Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from
shepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer
programmers, fiction?  With a scoff of your keyboard, with near
complete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that
that is all complete hooey?   Would that not be the most audacious
display of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better than
King Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincolnr?

Scuse, please, are you under the impression that this argument is made in
a vacuum, and that somehow only the fetus' potential life is being considered?

I would guess, from your 'very egocentric' comment that you do not, in which
case I have to ask just what the hell is wrong with egocentrism when one is
making a fundamental choice about one's life?  Don't *you* consult *your*

"Correct" overstates the case.  The whole point of the discussions
has been that it is *reasonable* to assume that there was some brief
reference to Jesus that has been doctored.  By consensus, this is
the *most* reasonable of the proposed solutions -- but not so much
so as to rule out complete fabrication.

You sound absolutely convinced! Tell me how long did it last, what color

though there is a fine line between "postulating new miracles" and postulating
new theories.
