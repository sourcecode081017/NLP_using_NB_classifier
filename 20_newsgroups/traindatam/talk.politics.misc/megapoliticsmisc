Yes, very serious.  I claim that I can substantiate my statement that
Rudman says he doesn't believe Perot was investigating him.  You claim
Perot was investigating him.  If you will state that you were in error
on this point, provided I produce the source, I'll go dig it up.

Now give me one reason why I should go to the trouble if you won't
agree to this?  It is simple enough you know.  But I don't have time
to waste if you'll just blow it off with more of the tripe you usually
post.

Which makes it legally unsound.  If I were representing Mr. Teel, 
I'd try a procedural approach if I could find one, or recommend 
he plea-bargain.  He's setting himself up to be in hot water.

How can you lie about something that no one knows for sure.  I am the first
to state that the 10% figure may be too high- but it may just be too low,
depending on what you are talking about.

Keep in mind that there are 'practicing' heterosexuals that are actually
gay.  These people chose to take a road that avoids being harassed and
they wanted to 'fit-in' with everyone other 'normal' person.

But let's get off of this irrational behavior of calling everyone a liar,
you cannot even start to support such claims.

This sure sounds definitive.  How do you label Kinsey's work like this,

This is an interesting statement.  Do you realize how many things you do
your life that are not based on 'mutual consent'- and that it may be
required on occasion that all parties may not be mutually consenting?

Oh I did not know that Le JoJo is a typical homosexual.

Stop making statements about something you know nothing about, that is
gay people.  You make your sweeping generalizations with no grounding 
in reality.


What I hope is not true- That you are a typical heterosexual.  Anyone want
to comment on this?

And if you are typical then I can start extrapolating a lot of interesting
conjectures about heterosexuals.

Indeed.  Reading the cases of people who've tried the various things
Mr. Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes: (1) those
who win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to their
claim, and (2) those who lose.

Consider Newman v. Schiff, 778 F.2d 460 (8th Cir.1985), which I've seen
cited by tax protestors other than Mr. Teel as a win for Mr. Schiff.
Mr. Schiff offered $100,000 on TV to anyone who would call in the
show and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says that
an individual has to file a return.

Mr. Newman took him up on it.  Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast
the next morning.  Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to
people who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offer
for Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, and
so Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000.

Mr. Schiff was correct, and so won.  So, yes, Mr. Schiff won against a
claim on the $100,000 reward.  However, his win had nothing to do with
the tax code.

Unless I've got my notes mixed up, 939 F.2d 499 comes close to this.
Regular guy.  Blue-collar worker at a regular company.  Hauled into
court.  Convicted.  Appeals to 7th circuit.  Makes all the right
arguments (his brief is cited by Mr. Teel as an example of a
"winning" brief).  Shot down, 3-zip by the 7th circuit.  Appeals to
the Supreme Court.  And...

...Certiorari denied.  Defendant goes to jail.  Oh well.

Nice dodge. I give it a 9.2.

I've answered your question. Would you now answer mine.

The tax protesters are legally correct, but they are put in jail anyway.

The weakness of the governments legal position is shown by the fact that when
someone protesting tax or gun laws on legal grounds gets a federal jury trial
(very rare) the feds blatantly stack the jury, with the same old faces turning
up time after time.

However Teel should have mentioned that though his advice is legally sound, if
you follow it you will probably wind up in jail.

Actually not.  Brett himself has actually posted the data previously.
What declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percent
increase_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit 
(2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased.
Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit
declined.  If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps
growing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed
previously, the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when your
income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.

Figgie's book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail.  Each
president, essentially ran up twice as much total debt, in half the time.
Reagan/congress was simply awful.  Bush/congress was unbelievable.

As a really rigorous aside to this thread.....

During pledge night the other night on the public channel, there was an
"economist" who gave an hour or so presentation.  His data was predictive
and based largely on population data. I don't know his name, but his
arguments were brilliant.  He confirmed, with data, what many of us know
with common sense -- the boom of the 80's has nothing to do with government
policy, particularly "supply side" policy, since taxes do not "cause" 
economic activities.  People cause economic activity.  More can be 
explained by watching population waves roll through the years and 
create cycles.  He has made models and predictions for years well into
the middle of next century.  It will be neat to see how accurate he
is.

Undoubtedly.  In fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete
for physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and 
undermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care.

>Hospitals tend to lose money on all sorts of high-tech, high-price 
>machinery. They manage to make it up on other charges.

Once again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney
dialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services
to a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service.
Otherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the
vast expansion that has occurred.

Can you spell "loss leader?"  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do not
attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of
it.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader 
for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.  

But the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that
price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of
service and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide 
comparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply
make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had 
risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.

There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD 
substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday
predictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction
of service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears
that in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers 
are government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.  
(RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to
Seattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)  

The bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government 
intervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial
results for both providers and consumers.  Claims that "government
bureaucracy" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace
should take such such cases into account.

Replying to A.J. Teel:

	Well, the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the
	Income Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for
	stopping withholding, et cetera have been out there for a
	while now.

Humbug.  Those letters don't provide "concrete proof" of anything at all
in the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu-
ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations.

Specifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that
income tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have to
pay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with-
out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness).  This
issue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect
something squarely on point from the US Supreme Court (in the case of
federal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax).

Unless you can do that, I for one am unwilling to call your material
"concrete proof".

	There has been no refutation to date.  Have the nay-sayers
	finally given up as defeated?  Sure would like to hear their
	reasons for disbelief at this point.

Refutation??  Refutation of what?  You haven't made a case yet.  You've
posted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason to
believe that any court in the US will agree with you.  Your claims seem
on the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I
feel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your arguments
have any merit whatsoever.  And the cases you've cited involve such
strange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are
applicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal
to the Supreme Court.

Why can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular
employee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay
his income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva-
sion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court
with a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally
voluntary?  What, you say?  No such case exists?  Hmmm, I wonder why
not; why haven't you?

	Shall I conclude that the point has been received and the
	opposition has forfeited the field?

With all due respect, you can conclude anything you want.  I just hope,
for your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of
authority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit-
ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions.

For that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would
be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought you
told us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big
banking interests since the 1938 "admiralty jurisdiction" coverup thing.
Do you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble
to subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into
their burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right
combination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?

Not only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway?
Didn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by US
officials to classify you as a "14th Amendment federal citizen"?  When
the FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell
them they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington,
D.C., where they belong?

Or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you
suggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like.
If you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just
declare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads
with no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet
can just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with
plenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).

Sorry, everyone, it's getting late, and I'm sick and tired of all this
garbage.  If I know what's good for me, I'll just clam up and stop try-
ing to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up in
jail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head.

Needless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my current
employer -- who, in any case, is a Canadian and doesn't really need to
care too much about US tax law.  I, on the other hand, am a "14th Amend-
ment federal citizen", with a US passport to prove it, and plan to keep
on filing Form 1040's for the foreseeable future (though I will probably
not owe any US income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusion
and/or the foreign tax credit).

Now let me get this straight.  After a nice, long rant about how
people need to take personal responsibility for their economic and
social lives, all of a sudden 1960's radicals (such as me, I guess)
are responsible for poor people's lifestyles?  Tell me how that
works--or do you think that poor people are just too dumb to think
for themselves?

There are many reasons for the disintegration of the family and
support systems in general among this nation's poor.  Somehow I
don't think Murphy Brown--or Janis Joplin--is at the top of any 
sane person's list.

You want to go after my generation's vaunted cultural revolution for
a lasting change for the worse, try so-called "relevant" or "values"
education.  Hey, it seemed like a good idea at the time.  How were
we to know you needed a real education first--I mean, we took that
for granted.

I"M CHANGING MY NAME TO CHRYSLER
(Tom Paxton, 1980)

Oh the price of gold is rising out of sight
And the dollar is in sorry shape tonight
What the dollar used to get us
Now won't buy a head of lettus
No the economic forecast isn't right
But amidst the clouds I spot a shining ray
I caneven glimpse a new and better way
And I've devised a plan of action
Worked it down to the last fraction
And I'm going into action here today.

Chorus:

  I am changing my name to Chrysler
  I am going down to Washington D.C.
  I will tell some power broker
  What they did for Iacoca
  Will be perfectly acceptable to me.
  I am changing my name to Chrysler
  I am heading for that great receiving line
  So when they hand a million grand out
  I'll be standing with my hand out
  Yes sir I'll get mine

When my creditors are screaming for their dough
I'll be proud to tell them all where they can go
They won'y have to scream and holler
They'll all be paid to the last dollar
Where the endless streams of money seam to flow
I'll be glad to tell them all what they can do
Its just a matter of a simple form or two
It's not renumeration it's a liberal education
Ain't you kind of glad that I'm in debt to you

Chorus

Since the first first amphibians crawled out of the slime
We've been struggling in an unrelenting climb
We were hardly up and walking before money started talking
And it's sad failure is an awful crime
It's been that way for a millennium or two
But now it seems there's a different point of view
If you're a corporate titanic and your failure is gigantic
Down in congress there is a safety net for you.

Chorus...



Perhaps Steven Jobs should take Paxton's advice and change his name to
Chrysler, or perhaps set himself up as an S&L, maybe Neil Bush could
give him a hand?

Yes, it was Nixon who was most vocal about giving money to Russia.  It
makes me proud to be a libertarian.  It appears both conservatives and
liberals prefer to cold war until you win, then nurse the enemy back to
health for another go around.

It's like subsidizing the wealthy countries (Japan, Germany, etc.) with
free defense, and then trade-warring with them because of the economic
competition.  It's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying
bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke.

I ask myself, what law could we pass to prevent government from doing
stupid, frivilous things with OUR money?  Then I think, the Constitution
was supposed to do that.  Could someone please tell me what legitimate
constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money
from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries?  Seriously.

So the only people who are citizens of a state are ones who don't live

There is nothing crystal clear about YOU PEOPLE other than a term
that includes those people defined by the statement that anyone who
believes that the behavior is justifiable is a bigoted, racist pig and
YOU PEOPLE know who you are.

                             AND POLITICAL EXPO

Institute, and Political Expo are at the Salt Palace; breakfasts, parties, and
banquet are at the Marriott Hotel.

                                  Know About Winning Elections, but
                                  Didn't Know Where to Ask!

Three days of intensive campaign training conducted by Sal Guzzetta, a
25 year veteran of more than 200 campaigns.  Students receive 990 pages
of professional campaign manuals.  Everything from strategy and
targeting to opposition research, fundraising, and field operations.

Price:           $150 if purchased by May 1, 1993

                                  National committee meetings.

Shoot out in Salt Lake!  PLEDGE versus Committee for a Libertarian
Majority.  Will the party's membership and platform definitions change? 
Is compromise possible?  The Platform and Bylaws committees are
responsible for making recommendations to the convention concerning
changes in those documents.  At this convention, the party will only
consider deletions to the platform.  The Convention Rules would have to
be amended by a 2/3 vote to change this rule.

The meetings are open to the public.  There is no charge for attending.

The key word is `spilled'.  If semen was spilled anywhere where there
was a chance of procreation it was OK.  If it was spilt on the ground or
in to a man it was a big sin, ditto with animals. The jews said sex=pro-
creation.

Homosexuals didn't breed, there fore they are evil and should be stoned
to death.

GOT HIM!  Cramer is now claiming that pedophilia is a sexual orientation
rather than a chronicly homosexual condition.  This changes the whole
argument in as much that is pedophilia is a sexual orientation all
of its own peds cannot be called homosexual.  Peds are peds who
may have a preference as to the sex of the child they molest (though
most do not have a preference) but that is a subset of their basic
ped nature.

Cramer has as much as admitted that peds and gay men are different
orientations.  All we need now is to get him to admit that
the apparent similarities he keeps on about are just optical illusions.

Who gave you the authority to create and enforce this rather

we don't need to stick to it or stick up for it unless we so

If I have confused two different stories, it was an honest mistake but I do
not see why it becomes an exageration of either.  They both took place and
are both equally disgusting behavior for any country, let alone one that

Very simple.  An 'Insurance Commissioner' is a bureaucrat - a regulator.
It is his/her duties to make rules to enforce laws.  He/she cannot
make laws.  If there is no law that covers a specific subject, say
scam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one.  So they have
to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted.  For
the California Insurance Commissioner, there are two possible legislative
bodies:  the California State Legislature and the U.S. Congress.  We all
know how little the California State Legislature accomplishes, esp. 
along the lines of insurance reform legislation (negative movement).  So
Garamendi wants the feds to do it, because: (a) he has a better chance
of getting a federal law through, and (b) since many of the scam
companies work across state lines/national borders, it is better to
have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions.

Last night I heard something about Bill Clinton's sister being
involved in a marijuana bust, and the news being suppressed. I also
heard something about her being an "ex-con". This source is not
reliable, though. (It was a collage/booklet advertising a local band.)

Can anyone on the net verify this or provide more details? I'm
surprised I haven't seen anything about this in this newsgroup.

Also, does anyone know what happened to the charges that Shalala was a
regular pot smoker when she was in college? This ghastly accusation
was reported on CNN Streamline News the day she was nominated, then I
never heard anything about it again.

It's almost enough to make me want to start an Act-Up type campaign
to invade the privacy of closet smokers! (If only this type of
publicity didn't violate people's rights. . . .)

I can only say that those people are wrong. The word harass means to 
irritate or torment persistently; I'd hardly consider one time to fall
under the definition of persistent.  Additionally, there is no basis
to assume the behaviour is unwanted, unlike an illegal proposition.

I was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint.  What you say is true, but
the law, in order to make what little sense it manages to make, has to
make *some* assumptions.  Assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted
by the average citizen I think is reasonable.  Certainly, I would need
a preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there
was a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome.

The number of people who participate in "victimless" crimes notwithstanding,
the fact reamins that under the law, the activity is illegal.  To presume
that the proposition *is* welcome simply because a large number of people
indulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in
with a straight face.

Enemy?  Sounds like that's the viewpoint of the stereotypical rednecked
conservative -- 'always been commies, always will be.'  I suggest you
listen very carefully to the stuff Yeltsin and his people are saying
and compare that with the very anti-West slogans coming from his
opponents in the Russian congress.  I sure know who I want to back.

Oh, BTW, Germany has sure come back as a terrible enemy after WWII,
hasn't it?

Better to let them degenerate into civil war?  Remember all those
nuclear weapons in Russia.  I cannot imagine that they would not
be used in a civil war.  If nationialists take over and, even if
they prevent a civil war, most feel they must take back large
parts of land that are in other countries (like Ukraine.)  I also cannot
imagine Ukraine giving up land without a fight, possibly nuclear.

How does this affect us?  Well, we are on the same planet and if
vast tracks of Europe are blown away I think we'd feel something.
A massive breakup of a country that spans 1/6th the planet is
bound to have affects here.  (Of course, there is also the
humanitarian argument that democracies should help other
democracies (or struggling democracies).)

Seriously.  Everyone has different opinions on what is stupid.
My two "causes" are aid to Russia and a strong space program.
Someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies
of drunken goldfish.  That is why we have a republic and not a
true democracy.  Instead of gridlock on a massive scale, we
only have gridlock on a congressional scale.

BTW, who is to decide 'stupid?'  This is just like those who
want to impose their 'morals' on others -- just the sort of
thing I thought Libertarians were against.

Actually, my politics are pretty Libertarian except on this one issue 
and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party.  It seems
that Libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and
let it sink or swim.  We could do that 100 years ago but not now.
Like it or not we are in the beginnings of a global economy and
global decision making.

Sorry, but I don't see how the response applies to what was posted.

Unless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys
from men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations
in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex
(due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least
some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the
children from abuse by members of the *same* sex.

If we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest
that if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a
practical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations
in which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse
them. By working together "with good will on both sides", we may be
able to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.

Mr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for
personal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long*
stretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish
and it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the
future.

I agree mostly with Chris.  It is (unfortunately, IMO) true that the *FBI*
figures for rape based on the 'uniform crime report' report only female
rapes. However, some states (such as Illinois) are not tabluated because they
refuse to comply with this sexist definition!

You mean, if a large part of the population supports discrimination

There may be some confusion here.  The Uniform Crime Reports program
run by the FBI defines rape as a female victim only crime -- even
though some states have the laws de-sexed.  I suspect that this causes
male victims of rape to be left out of the UCR data.

Yet, when a law was proposed for Virginia that extended this 
philosophy to cigarette smokers (so that people who smoked away
from the work couldn't be discriminated against by employers),
the liberal Gov. Wilder vetoed it.  Which shows that liberals don't
give a damn about "best person for the job," it's just a power
play.

Hitler became Chancellor because people voted for his political

This is an interesting question.  Steinbeck's _Grapes of Wrath_

production in Arkansas as the cause of the Joad family being evicted
from the land.  How many years were involved in the mechanization of
cotton farming?  When did this first appear?

Can you provide some evidence that the slave states regarded slaves as
not humans?  They were "outside our society" and similar phrases that
basically meant that they didn't have to recognized as having the same
rights as a free person, but they were never considered "not human" to
my knowledge.

If that were the case, the slave states would not have passed so many
laws that restricted the freedom of slave owners to do as they wished
with their property.  Examples: laws prohibiting manumission without
legislative grant; laws prohibiting teaching slaves to read & write.

Capital and labor are one and the same in a slave economy.  Except that
capital doesn't reproduce quite as readily as slaves did.

Slavery was a dying institution before the cotton gin, yes, but not
in 1850.

# #It is true that cotton suffered from price depression in the 1840's -

# 
# That is not the argument that I have heard. It would not have lasted because

#  spilling over to the Southern states, i.e. Northern industry would have 
#  migrated capital to the Southern states, and with that would have come

#  "Cruel Hearts and Hatred for Black People" would have been driven out of
#  business. Simple capital to labor ratio...read Michael Parkin _Microeconomics_
#  2nd edition, and any other basic economics book.

This assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments
would not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the
North.  Since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else
to destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, I do not doubt
that they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive
threat.  Thomas Sowell's _Market and Minorities_ argues that the
maintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and local
governments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outside
capital investment in the Southern states.

Of course, free trade and slavery don't make much sense together in
a phrase anyway.  Perhaps Mr. Depken meant, "low import tariffs," but
that is quite a bit less than "free trade."

I don't think that this is accurate. I believe, and could be wrong, that
there IS a specific right allegedly to have been violated, like the

Double jeopardy does not apply, but not for the reasons you quote. Double
jeopardy states that a person may not be tried twice on the same charge.
However, the police are not on trial for the crime of excessive force
or assault. They are NOW on trial for the DIFFERENT crime of violating
Mr. King's civil rights. 

AS for the city and county or state trying you more than once, 
it most likely will not happen. This is because cities and states
have separate laws governing behaviour. For example, in some states,
it is an offence to carry marijuana, but not a city offence. Also,
I think murder is against federal, but not some state laws.

    You're being too generous to the communists, I think.  In practice,
communism has "solved" the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_
productive, and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the
rest of the group is a bunch of sluggards.  The mass butchery of "kulaks"
in the USSR is a good instance of this.
    A poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to which
people of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee.  I often wonder
just what Castro would have done if the Cubans presently in Miami would
have been forced to remain in Cuba.  Would they have revolted and killed
him off, or been killed?
    Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in,
load it up so heavily with attack dogs, barbed wire, and land mines that
most people fleeing over it die, and then give everyone the choice of
obedience, prison, or flight.  This would be a bad science-fiction novel,
if the East Germans hadn't actually done it.  The last person to die
crossing the wall, as I recall, was an unarmed woman who was shot in the
back.  Erich Honecker was going to go on trial for that, but he fled to
socialists in Chile.
    It's good to be kind to one's intellectual opponents, but sometimes
it's a sheer waste of time.

Since you asked, Article I Section 1.  Article I Section 8.  Article I 
Section 10.  Article II Section 2.  Article VI.  Sixteenth Amendment.

With this as a guide, try reading it yourself.

	This is such a fine example of Jack's antisemitic bigotry that I 
couldn't help but do a follow-up. 

	A poster attempts to discuss an event rationally, with no indication
at all that he is identified with any specific ethnic group - he is merely
talking in terms that might apply to ANY group in similar circumstances.

	Schmidling comes back with a rabid attack against YOU PEOPLE, as if
it were crystal clear that the Jewish people as a whole were culpable for this
man's statements - even if he were not Jewish. Jack considers the Jewish people
to be responsible for all the acts of the supporters of Israel, irrespective of
their age, religion, gender, skin color, or sexual orientation.

	The .sig, please.

	My mother-in-law, who grew up in Germany, doesn't believe in

horses. She keeps telling me that inflation is coming back, and to lock
in my fixed rate mortgage as low as possible.

	The word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the "B"
word, or the "H" word, or even the "N" or "W" words. It is the "L" word -
LOSER !!

	That's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it
is all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.

	Remember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail
buffer can claim they are "too young" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet.
The eighties were about "How America Learned to Win Once Again". Then
(wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win.
No Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer
(We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no
holds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a
few "little" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an
S&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to
contend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never had
it so good. 

	In the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one
doesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a "kinder and gentler
type of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of
discourse about people who "don't get it". For those of us in the winning
business, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no 
suggestion of losing.

	But what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our 
"white male" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out 
photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one
with a "Hail Mary" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'three
yards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses
in the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the 
weapon of choice these days. 
	
	Who is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on 
your face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This 
is known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt 
sure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the 
same. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to 
take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?

	What we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is 
the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood
used to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott
declaimed, "Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will 
not tolerate a loser." And so on. 

	The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and
Democrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some 
"equitable" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a 
loser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian
homosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined
day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) 
minority.

	Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most
conservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care
who's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say something
about make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition).
In the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a 
"neoconservative" or a "neoliberal" depending on how much you want to limit
the pot.

	Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be
popular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still
be popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I 
would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it
is the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any
other place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in
Columbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in
the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to 
see more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious 
preference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of 
them be white men !! (We should DEFINITELY let the Buckeyes win the Rose Bowl
someday)

   This I gotta see some authority for.

from Black's Law Dictionary, Revised 4th Ed., page 1473:

RESIDENCE.  A factual place of abode.  Living in a particular
locality.  Reese v. Reese, 179 Misc. 665, 40 N.Y.S.2d 468, 472;
Zimmerman, 175 Or. 585, 155 P.2d 293, 295.  It requires only bodily
presence as an inhabitant of a place.  In re Campbell's Guardianship,
216 Minn. 113, 11 N.W.2d 786, 789.

     As ``domicile'' and ``residence'' are usually in the same place,
they are frequently used as if they had the same meaning, but they are
not identical terms, for a person may have two places of residence, as
in the city and country, but only one domicile.  Residence means
living in a particular locality, but domicile means living in that
locality with intent to make it a fixed and permanent home.  Residence
simply requires bodily presence as an inhabitant in a given place,
while domicile requires bodily presence in that place and also an
intention to make it one's domicile.  In re Riley's Will, 266 N.Y.S.
209, 148 Misc. 588.  ``Residence'' demands less intimate local ties
than ``domicile,'' but ``domicile'' allows absence for indefinite
period if intent to return remains.  Immigration Act 1917, sec. 3, 8
U.S.C.A. sec. 136 (e, p).  Transatlantica Italiana v. Elting,
C.C.A.N.Y., 74 F.2d 732, 733.  But see, Ward v. Ward, 115, W.Va 429,
176 S.E. 708, 709; Southwestern Greyhound Lines v. Craig, 182 Okl.
610, 80 P 2d 221, 224; holding that residence and domicile are
synonymous terms.  ``Residence'' has a meaning dependent on context
and purpose of statute.  In re Jones, 341 Pa. 329, 19 A.2d 280, 282.
Words ``residence'' and ``domicile'' may have an identical or variable
meaning depending on subject-matter and context of statute.  Kemp v.
Kemp, 16 N.Y.S.2d 26, 34, 172 Misc. 738.

     Legal residence.  See Legal.

RESIDENT.  One who has his residence in a place.  See Residence.

     Also a tenant, who was obliged to reside on his lord's land, and
not to depart from the same; called, also, ``homme levant et
couchant,'' and in Normandy, ``resseant du fief.''

And who's advocating that?  Hate crimes laws are aimed at the motivations
of the acts.  Just like premeditated homicide is treated stricter than
heat-of-passion homicide.

So if I set off a bomb in the World Trade Center, I can only be charged with
more than one murder, and not the other five deaths and extensive property
damage?  After all, the bomb was a single act.

Glad to see that you agree that the current Government is reticent
about admitting the sovereignty of the people!  Speaking from personal
experience, I have had judges illegally assume jurisdiction even after
I demanded that the DA prove such jurisdiction on the record, and the
DA stood mute.  I have also had an appellate court uphold such action
and hide behind California Rules of Court, Rule 106 ("The judges of
the appellate department shall not be required to write opinions in
any cases decided by them, but may do so whenever they deem it
advisable or in the public interest.").  That is reality, I agree.

Maybe we should ask the 83,103 people who were laid off this January whether
or not we're in a recession. That was a figure that was reported in the
New York Times. There is no official figure, because the Bureau of Labor
Statistics stopped government tracking of layoffs eight months ago due to
budget cuts.

Again, Mr. Frank has come to the rescue with his cool headed reason.  How
about, "One charge per victim?"  Of course I'll think about it in a few days
and find a case where this doesn't apply either.  

What the heck, I don't study law, I just hate lawyers. :)

Wasn't the beef with the English over "taxation WITHOUT REPRESENTATION",
not taxation itself?  

From my admittedly dim recollection of US history, most of the problems 
we Americans have had with taxes have been with unfair/unjust taxation
schemes, not with taxes themselves.  It's pretty hard to run a government
without any means of support.

Maybe because the claims deserve refute?  The above abstract lists various
possible links to cannabis use (unfiltered almost guaranteed) and lung
problems.  Someone may get overly excited when they see that article, but 
without actually digging up the study and seeing how the studies gathered 
their data it really doesn't tell you shit.  I'm going to track down that
study hopefully tomarrow.

What justifies _the_ truth about drugs?  Research?  What sort of 
research?  Correlational data can help establish a theory, but it does not
prove anything.

Heroin _is_ a relatively safe drug.  What makes it unsafe are IV administration
and shit like adulterants.  There are side effects, like withdrawal, but they
effect people differently.

Stereotypical statement.  I know people who use heroin and opiates that 
function just fine in society.  

>This group does

Name some of these drugs so we can debate about them more specifically.

NO, NO, NO.  (or at least I haven't been arguing this).  there is not enough
data to form a scientific conclusion.  that _doesn't_ mean that cannabis
is benign to users' lungs.  we can form all the theories we want, but they
are only theories.  some theories are supported by more evidence than others,
and that makes them stronger.

the hell I can't!  they state *UN-JUSTIFIED CONCLUSIONS* *AS FACT* as
a *POLITICAL* strategy to stop drug use.

[...]

In general, I somewhat see what you're saying.  And people like Jack Herer
contribute to this.  This has been quite a big mind-fuck for me recently,
and I've pretty came to the conclusion that you can't trust _ANYBODY_ by
word of mouth alone -- my attitude about the general population has
decreased significantly.  

gotta run to class..

libertarianism, but that is a philisophical disagreement, not a tactical

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration
rate for violent crimes.

So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism
present.

There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.

Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern
United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in
the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt
blacks.

In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are
reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).

Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and
some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a
situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the
population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.

Blacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences,
except in the South, where they receive around 20% less on paper!!

Ed:

    Before you ridicule the intelligence of other people, LEARN TO SPELL. 
Your typographical errors are, indeed, "embarassing" to those of us who
read alt.politics.libertarian for its allegedly superior ideas and writing.

The 1960's generation were the most spoiled and irresponsible.

The Depression had create mothers and fathers that were determined that their
kids would not want for anything -- going overboard and creating a nation of
brats.

Consider the contrast between two famous events in July of 1969.

Apollo 11 and Woodstock.

Which group had large numbers of people that could not feed themselves and
reverted to the cultural level of primitives (defecation in public etc.).

And which group assembled, took care of itself, and dispersed with no damage,
no deaths, no large numbers of drug problems ....

Well, the message was interesting (and long), but TWICE? Oh Well. Personally,
I loathe libertarianism, but my disagreement is philisophical, not tactical.
Election law reform is a good idea. You would not believe what kind of stunts
the creatures of the 2 party system are capable of pulling.

Boy is this guy in for a shock when he hits the real world!  Our tax rate 
is incredibly high, higher than many European countries -- it is just
packaged differently (income, Social inSecurity, Medicare, payroll taxes,
property taxes, sales taxes, fees, mandatory disability insurance, state, 
federal, local, etc. etc. etc.).  Other countries just haven't found as
many ways to hide "revenue enhancers" as our clever American politicians.

I hope you enjoy the $8K you actually get to spend from your first $25K
job out of school, Rob, you patriot you.

My apologies.  Your right.  I wasn't following the thread.  But I think
most women are tougher than that.  I am suprised that someone would

  Government-Mandated Energy Conservation is Unnecessary and Wastful, Study Finds

  Washington, DC -- The energy tax and subsidized energy-efficiency
  measures supported by President Clinton and Energy Secretary Hazel
  O'Leary are based on faulty assumptions, a new study from the Cato
  Institute points out.

    According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies,
  we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10
  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of
  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as
  dramatically.

    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial
  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy
  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group
  of Seven nations.

    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil
  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the
  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,
  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the
  overall U.S. economy.

    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per
  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.

    Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side
  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource
  inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not
  reduce demand.

    Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes
  unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that
  subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,
  gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood
  of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state
  at the expense of the individual.

    "Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion" is no.

                        The Cato Institute

    Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research
  foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate
  to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the
  traditional American principles of limited government, individual
  liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve
  greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in 
  questions of policy and the proper role of government.
    The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets
  that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th
  century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation
  of the American Revolution.
    Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually
  no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive
  intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary
  intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for
  civil liberties.
    To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive
  publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy
  issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned
  to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military
  spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy
  conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are
  published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.
    In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts
  no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations,
  corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from
  the sale of publications.  The Institute is a nonprofit, tax-exempt,
  educational foundation under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue
  Code.

This is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington,
DC  20006.

   Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30,
1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.

  It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South
Atlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute
between Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept
Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far
more than that.

   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a
giant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,
fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South
Atlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the
hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on
all sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the
Southern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.

   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of
the Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a
counterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.

   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of
time, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is
coming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are
overextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot
simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time
without drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British
will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no
matter how risky they may be.

   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no
choice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That
reason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered
losses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will
be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by
the British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts
will the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle
losses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice
but to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking
even heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,
my friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.

   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,
ironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearing
countless commentators referring to the British task force as an
"armada" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very
uneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400
years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,
but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it
changed the course of history--and it was none other than the
English navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.

   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the
reign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion
fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. 
They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake
and his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada
by changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped
with new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of
reach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered
the big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely
half the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake's
defeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened
the door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its
expansion into a truly global empire.

   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full
circle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the
world empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now
the cultures of England and of Spain are once again in
confrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for
invasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four
hundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;
today, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.

   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake
Passage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of
the Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's
naval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may
well break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal
Navy.

   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:

Topic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND
Topic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE
Topic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.

Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month
it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and
a half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great
Britain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the
Falklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been
countless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it
calls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing
in the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about
them.

   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba
is from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. 
After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer
than 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the
remote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,
and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are
watching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.

   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all
about its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's
doorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's
got at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,
submarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have
even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. 
Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated
and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and
submarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and
sent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has
grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada
numbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has
already been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.

   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this
fight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the
major media is "oil."  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist
under the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,
but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it
explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina
this month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine
seizure of South Georgia Island.

   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with
no known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South
Georgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia
Island is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,
glaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. 
On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or
historical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it
stands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.

   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by
Argentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took
over the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,
Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,
not Britain.

   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It
has always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or
Spain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even
more unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's
leaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They
were well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island
could not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were
setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island
was retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's
military junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia
Island at all?

   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,
not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an
enormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation
buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. 
The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret
installation, together with two other similar installations which
I will describe shortly.

   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many
years; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear
war timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in
Washington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the
details of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain
and verify them.

   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of
this year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat
that caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.

   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of
the Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The
mutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the
Rockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are
behind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of
the "PROJECT Z" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase
is to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both
Russia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR
ONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the
existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around
the world.

   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are
working with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of
other countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to
ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in
Government war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie
smoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered
remains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the
secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the
open.  They will confront the world with the only remaining
fresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using
that military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of
the world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to
pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off
NUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel
and Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a
race against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.

   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are
benefitting from war preparations which were started by the
Rockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since
the Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United
States Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United
States Government has been a house divided, torn by internal
power struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. 
But before that, the United States had been dominated for decades
both economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller
Brothers.

   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world
domination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half
secret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. 
It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret
while appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the
details, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By
deliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United
States would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. 
Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be
unleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.

   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the
Rockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the
late 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that
the war being planned would have very different effects on the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United
States and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern
Hemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great
Britain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the
strategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are
relatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected
that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern
Hemisphere war.

   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious
radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas
not initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the
war clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is
very little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern
Hemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from
the North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then
it works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image
of this process takes up the southern half of the planet. 
Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,
but very little of the air changes places.

   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming
nuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for
generations to come; but if the calculations are right, the
Southern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. 
This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A
quick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller
cartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I
discussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson
Rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during
the war.  He accomplished this as so-called "Coordinator of
Hemispheric Defense" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
So that takes care of the South American continent and its
natural resources.

   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller
control was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,
especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the
efforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER
No. 36.

   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land
masses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and
New Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the
Rockefellers.

   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military
installations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming
war.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the
surviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern
Hemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually
recovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire
would be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third
generation Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to
inherit the Earth.

   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after
the war, some means would have to be available to project
military power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against
Rockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the
beam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar
military domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A
minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based
in the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the
reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the
Northern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in
existing shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built
and they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no
small task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was
essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. 
The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and
naval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the
secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear
attack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered
prematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.

   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection
against attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all
these plans were still in the early stages of development, the
answer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to
Sweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden
naval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs
which come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is
a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off
with enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water
a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.

   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided
that a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the
Swedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of
candidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered
coastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas
were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. 
Other areas were rejected because they were too close to the
equator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too
many people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy
impossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for
the secret naval installations be totally secure politically.

   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were
selected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was
selected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71
three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme
importance in the coming war.

   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand
naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located
close together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South
Island where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes
down virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the
installation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,
which is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island
facility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.

   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since
World War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even
closer to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location
is far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep
under mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also
too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New
Zealand site is well situated to command the entire South
Pacific.

   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. 
That site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located
perfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The
tall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret
installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. 
It is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of
New Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island
was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the
northeast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from
the secret new installation which was being built, but Britain
took no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. 
Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia
Island except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.

   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New
Zealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's. 
The techniques were adapted from those used previously to build
other large underground facilities, such as the NORAD
installation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these
techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve
construction access directly from the sea instead of overland. 
In this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in
appearance both during and after construction.

   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let
ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well
camouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the
entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When
sealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you
know exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction
projects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying
around to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house
the secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and
debris was disposed of at sea.

   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be
outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake
disarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed
greatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal
role in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary
of Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamara
presided over the public paring back of America's visible
military power.  This included the closing down and dismantling
of entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that
shipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,
was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in
New Zealand and South Georgia Island!

   The secret naval installations have been used as duplication
facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and
built here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two
ships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is
an exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true
in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing
techniques.

   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret
installations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of
certain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear
powered--nuclear "subs"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;
and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin
was built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and
for the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been
financed through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we
constantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three
carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft
whose manufacture was financed the same way!

   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are
all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the
secret naval ships possess one key difference.

   Last month I revealed that the so-called "Stealth Program" has
succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility
shield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance
by distorting light waves in its vicinity.

   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into
crash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of
the secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been
outfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth
principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes
because there is more room for the powerful equipment that
generates the field.

   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American
Bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on
earth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world
domination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my
friends, but three years ago they lost control of the United
States Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in
control, and they are bent on war.

   These secret naval installations have precipitated what is
being called the "Falklands crisis."

Topic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described
"PROJECT Z", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR
WAR ONE.

   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here
are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in
Washington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strike
the first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war
with Russia.

   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in
certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable
war bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in
stalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United
States and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand
strategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially
their secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and
rule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it
will be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks
themselves, this outcome will constitute victory.

   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two
months ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for
nuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is
fast running out.

   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward
war; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in
this race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are
equally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the
Bolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the
new anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two
mutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in
certain ways.

   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a
limited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between
the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting
between Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning
point in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,
and is responsible for the so-called "Falkland crisis" now
dominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new
relationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far
short of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be
settled between them, but for the time being they have called a
truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly
enemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.

   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to
slow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. 
If they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller
cartel in certain political movements which I discussed last
summer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war
timetable will also give more breathing space for additional
anti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.

   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February
that military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very
quickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect
fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.

   The exact details of the "PROJECT Z" war plan are not known to
either the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines
are known to be as I described last month.

   It was decided that military action should be devised that
would undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the
Bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the
Southern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working
together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to
devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. 
The Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these
bases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to
attack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine
provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.

   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both
secret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be
attacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the
Bolshevik war plan still workable.

   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault
on the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was
no combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force
which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside
world.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the
very war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.

   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different
matter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was
also its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected
the secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military
assault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her
long-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.

   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has
dominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives
were sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government
military junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland
Islands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to
enable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine
generals were not told everything about the situation by any
means, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to
do.

   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were
promised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the
shooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine
hands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military
assistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the
troubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller
cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With
these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,
the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.

   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack
plan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,
landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia
Island.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old
buildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they
also raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,
always nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as
expected.  The British Antarctic survey ship "Endurance" put 22
Marines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down
the Argentine flag.

   The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine
Junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a
boil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that
South Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered
that way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now
came in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from
Argentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.

   During late March, Argentine military forces started
assembling for an assault on the Falklands.  "Nothing new",
thought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out
threatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed
that they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine
forces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this
time they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine
public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims
to the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next
day a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia
Island.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance
initially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of
view; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were
overpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13
alleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint
Rockefeller-Russian attack plan.

   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine
forces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. 
Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the
team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the
cavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was
set up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian
members concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,
April 3, the military high command in London finally learned what
was really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under
attack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint
Rockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the
mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a
matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling
of the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next
step was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a
weapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it
would be a nerve gas.

   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the
British government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be
described, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the
so-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik
controlled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, "Me, too"
any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against
Russia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war
plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective
countries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered
that their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.

   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval
armada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of
the day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding
around the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling
would break through into the roof of the naval base in about
three weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South
Georgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The
forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend
themselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships
were ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to
sail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with
tactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance
doors would be suicide.

   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was
seized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. 
The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He
was forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the
Rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack
preparations.

   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other
secret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. 
The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on "Red
Alert."  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin
base were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at
sea undergoing "sea trials", but that still left seven (7) major
ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the
nuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.

   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister,
Costa Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was
alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. 
Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from
certain officials.  He got them!

   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories
about the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while
negotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. 
The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as
possible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived
in time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The
official stories about "slow movement" of the British armada were
intended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,
the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,
then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the
announced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South
Georgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.

   It was initially expected that advance elements of the British
fleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two
weeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint
Rockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it
was completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a
shambles of the plan.

   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent
left Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was
announced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into
trouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on
a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on
South Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and
combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In
moments the ship was without any command, its communications and
radar silenced.  Then a Russian "sub" closed in and quickly
finished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke
apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is
known, there were no survivors.

   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two
results, both important:

First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic
by the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a
configuration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost
valuable time.  Public announcements from London about the
progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for
arrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching
out longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint
commando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.

The other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was
flashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible
action.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting
involved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could
be in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the
seven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in
southern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational
headquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast
of New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to
provide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible
to communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I
explained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the
Stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded
communication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes
headquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South
Georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of
South America.  The deployment of the available ships of the
South Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint
Rockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been
flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in
New Zealand!

   The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by
other events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out
of port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos
Aires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he
was there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top
Governmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have
revealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did
not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four
days later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded
his plane, Haig somberly told reporters, "Time is running out." 
And so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.

   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the
hollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military
analysts in London had not expected that it could be completed
until at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was
still out of range.

   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the
long hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was
detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the
effects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed
everyone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the
bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside
sufficiently to badly disable them.

   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging
on the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands
awaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to
the eye due to their protective shields, which also protect
against beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the
tactics which the Russians employed.

   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships
using their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. 
As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which
PRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations
of the ships to the attack submarines.  The "subs" were armed
with special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to
explode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been
thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective
shield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right
through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. 
Within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik
Stealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went
their Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from
around the world.

   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local
time.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. 
That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public
with the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was
wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught
always to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning
from ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian
military operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret
Bolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,
bottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific
fleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By
working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won
the secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.

Topic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression
that war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real
war in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are
watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That
aftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been
promised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.

   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing
for a public announcement that the United States will side with
Britain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat
up fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to
fight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be
explained without a public battle; but by fighting, the
Bolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and
tragic defeat for the Royal Navy.

   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now
concentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On
all sides now we are hearing about the so-called "nuclear freeze
movement."  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all
kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent
months, there have even been referenda popping up on election
ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are
banding together to warn the public about what would happen if
there were a nuclear war.

   We are being told that all this is just popping up
spontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and
nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet
now we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have
spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you
believe that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,
and I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and
money--and plenty of it.

   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations
machine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller
cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it
does, they will lose everything because they are not in a
position to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the
Rockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is
a war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in
its power to prevent a nuclear war.

   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller
cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them
and Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does
not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the
Rockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessity
right now for the Rockefellers.

   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and
they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with
the Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of
the deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear
war; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of
reckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.

   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective
with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is
renewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old
dream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly
provided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar
campaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan
Administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people. 
The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on
that latent fear as a tool of power.

   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands
crisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller
propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that
surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new
super-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the
bill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new
organization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working
name, though this may be changed, is the "World Nonproliferation
Council."  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of
nuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be
to use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.

                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY

   Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO
LETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called
Falkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret
Bolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern
Hemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the
Rockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down
the nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the
results remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal
Navy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at sea
may well be at hand.

   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our
United States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They
differ in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we
are ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the
power of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture
tells us, our Lord "...has not given us the spirit of fear; but
of power, of love, and of a sound mind."  We must learn to wage
peace.  As our Lord declared long ago, "Blessed are the
peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God."

   Until next month, God willing, this is Dr. Beter.  Thank you,
and may God bless each and every one of you.

This, of course, is an argument against any health care not explicitly

If the free market places an attractive price on the screwing in of a

most certainly get screwed in -- and most promptly at that, too.

Insofar as several "liberal" jurisdictions are concerned, the essential
elements of rape are gender neutral. Nonetheless, I decided to provide
a number of references to support my original argument. Black's Law
Dictionary (every law student/lawyer's friend) defines rape as: Unlawful
sexual intercourse with a female without her consent. The unlawful
knowledge of a woman by a man forcibly and against her will. The Model
Penal Code (the statute proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners
of Uniform State Laws or other organization for adoption by state legislatures)
defines rape as: A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife
is guilty of rape if he (a) compels her to submit by force or by threat of
imminent death.... (MPC @213.1(1)(a))

Indeed the following jurisdictions/states have statutes similar to the MPC:

Alabama-- Code of Ala. @13A-6-61 (1992)
Arkansas--Ark.Stat.Ann. @5-14-103 (1993)
District of Columbia--D.C. Code @22-2801 (1992)
Georgia--O.F.G.A. @16-6-1 (1992)
Idaho--Idaho Code @18-6101 (1992)
Maryland--Md.Ann.Code.Art. 27 @462 (1992)
Mississippi--Miss.Code Ann. @97-3-71 (1993)
New York (check case law)--N.Y.C.L.S. Penal @130.35 (1993)
North Carolina--N.C. Gen.Stat. @14-27-2 (1992)
Puerto Rico--L.P.R.A. @4062 (1993)

Ta,

Martina

                PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT
                        WITH RUSSIAN PRESS
	     
                           Canada Place
                   Vancouver, British Columbia



2:46 P.M. PDT

	     	  
	     Q	  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you 
could probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll 
give you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  The first is that this is the meeting of the 
Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government 
money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the 
government.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going 
to be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian 
businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What 
are the priorities, because there are several association of 
Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to 
participate in setting up priorities for investment?  
	     
	     This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know 
that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans 
are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls 
say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times 
published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; 
42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent 
if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to 
sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not 
very enthusiastic?  Thank you.
	     
	     Q	  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going 
to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the 
answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, 
it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, 
the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will 
obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be 
good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will 
be used to support the privatization of existing public 
enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the 
Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have 
some influence over the distribution of.  
	     
	     With regard to your second question, let me say that 
I would think that there would be people in both countries who 
would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government 
giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to 
that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history 
there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That 
is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole 
history of America, any kind of aid program has always been 
unpopular.  
	     
	     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is 
this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that 
this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --
trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments 
because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in 
Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them 
working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies 
going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it 
possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the 
economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and 
investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce 
nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on 
our side and on the Russian side.  
	     
	     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an 
investment for the United States.  This is very much in the 
interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the 
second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next 
week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for 
the taxpayers and workers of my country.  
	     
	     Russia is a very great nation that needs some 
partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share 
her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view 
this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not 
what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful 
investment.  
	     
	     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But 
there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than 
the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier 
of the Cold War.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, first of all thank you very 
much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory 
of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American 
President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind 
of a very measured breakthrough.  
	     
	     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory 
remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief 
that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you 
tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to 
what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification 
of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how 
confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager 
to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions 
inherited from the Cold War?  
	     
	     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of 
Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with 
regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent 
states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States 
develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing 
that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of 
the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude 
our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that 
would provide not only an important economic opportunity for 
Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out 
on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed 
off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and 
we agreed to continue to press that.
	     
	     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to 
reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the 
Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the 
United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, 
but that, in order to do what we need to do together to 
strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States 
be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join 
the NPT regime is critical.
	     
	     What was the second question?  
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and 
COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the 
Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, 
as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other 
restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on 
relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies 
of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of 
them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the 
leadership of the Congress.
	     
	     With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be 
an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there 
are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to 
emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there 
is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed 
to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be 
much less.
	     
	     With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing 
more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my 
own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement 
out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to 
begin it in the fairly near future.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in 
Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely 
different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not 
political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of 
Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the 
difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the 
difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of 
Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the 
last part of your speech?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to 
compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say 
what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a 
boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the 
music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been 
thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music 
for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists 
and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know 
as much as I could about your history.  
	     
	     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then 
the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last 
presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone 
in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. 
Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I 
was following events there very closely and hoping for the day 
when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a 
personal feeling about Russia.  
	     
	     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like 
music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a 
musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York 
Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony 
to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly 
than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically 
so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it 
occurred.  
	     
	     These are things that have always had a big impact 
on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever 
had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two 
countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)
	     
	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.

Since we are talking in theory and opinion, then I'll put in my $.02.
	First, a rebuttle. Personally, I love under-dogs. Unlike 
bandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People that
cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are
afraid to be associated with something negative.

On this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP's is 
because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is
going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top.
If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might
all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people 
for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had 
conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any
better/worse than the whites did.
	The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of
the world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done
(ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the
present generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do 
any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped
hundreds, even thousands, of years ago. 
	My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's change
them. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settle
anything anyway.

That's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just because
they are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school and
after high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make
you right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only
a couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, not
to yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care
how you appear (ie. a Winner).

	If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way.

                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS


                          The Briefing Room


 10:10 A.M. EDT
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon 
to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out 
the first pitch.
	     
	     Q	  It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not 
Amtrack.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's 
going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.
	     
	     Q	  George, what exactly are you prepared to do to 
break the logjam with  ??? Senate?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are 
discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning, 
and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point 
that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs 
to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for 
summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the 
important programs that will put people back to work right away this 
summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be 
passed.
	     
	     Q	  Will he compromise, that's the question?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions 
are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and 
Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President 
believes his jobs program should go forward.
	     
	     Q	  George, would the President be willing to accept $8 
billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise 
being offered by --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being 
offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right 
now, let's see what happens today.
	     
	     Q	  Would he go that far -- no matter what the 
Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per 
year?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his 
program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be 
willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to 
come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's 
see what happens.
	     
	     Q	  It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has 
happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order 
to get a vote?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more 
intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in 
doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the 
Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the 
President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action, 
real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no 
question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative 
activity over the last few days.
	     
	     Q	  So, you'll need to compromise to get your package 
through?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the 
conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.
	     
	     Q	     prepared to compromise --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen 
to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting 
with Senator Dole. 
	     
	     Q	  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's 
been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.
	     
	     Q	  How?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record 
time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by 
$500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for 
important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong 
passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a 
minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock 
and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that 
he is not succeeding overall.
	     
	     Q	  He can't beat this, can he?
	     
	     Q	  The fact is they can do that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop 
action.  There's no question about that.
	     
	     Q	  What are you going to do about it?
	     
	     Q	  George, what do you know about these alleged notes 
taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears 
that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that 
when they say yes they mean no?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete 
misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the 
conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring 
President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime 
Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's 
belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.  
I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and 
etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where 
he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese 
were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.
	     
	     Q	   Are you saying that the President said that when 
the Japanese say yes they mean no?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the 
exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say 
something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime 
Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.
	     
	     Q	  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the 
Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and 
there appears to be --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the 
Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It 
does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of 
view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that 
there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up 
but I'm not positive.
	     
	     Q	  George, was the specific comment that was made 
specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general 
observation on Japanese etiquette?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --
	     
	     Q	  The specific comment is what I'm asking about that 
has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, "when the 
Japanese say yes they mean no."
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean 
I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific 
comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific 
finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that 
Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.
	     
	     Q	  Was he saying it facetiously first?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual 
observation.
	     
	     Q	  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to 
clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President 
spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but 
I'm not sure exactly how many.
	     
	     Q	  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're 
making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got 
the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that 
it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no 
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the 
Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure 
there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is 
on.
	     
	     Q	  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they 
may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese 
is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two 
days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime 
Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. 
position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the 
Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's 
commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a 
constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to 
hear that.
	     
	     Q	  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq 
for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S. 
policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary 
Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have 
reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance 
with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.
	     
	     Q	     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, 
Saddam can't stay in office?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our 
judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with 
the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that 
we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will 
continue to demand it.
	     
	     Q	  And are you concerned the Iran will become the 
dominant power in the area --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also 
spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect 
full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping 
support of terrorism.
	     
	     Q	  That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in 
power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you 
base that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not 
complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the 
rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is 
not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  
He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding 
armaments.
	     
	     Q	  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he 
would be out of power?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on 
the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make 
it more difficult for him to stay in power.
	     
	     Q	  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it 
that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure 
politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence 
do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical 
difference with you that's in good faith?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times 
in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the 
fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now 
seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.  
	     
	     Q	  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate 
Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to 
them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had 
one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate 
Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and 
thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -
-
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true 
that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the 
Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the 
introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate 
Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are 
continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who 
have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in 
what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is 
important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.
	     
	     Q	     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats 
alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it 
through?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is 
no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can 
frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  
You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going 
and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.
	     
	     Q	     going to rethink the way you attempt to get 
other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of 
the summer?
	     
	     Q	     work with Republicans and try to woo some 
Republicans into your camp?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to 
look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the 
President's intiatives?
	     
	     Q	  But on this one -- how are you going to do it 
differently than you did it on this one because on this one you 
really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear 
that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and 
could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?  
Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for 
particular votes?  When you have to go through --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and 
understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the 
President's going to continue to reach out when he can.
	     
	     Q	  You don't have any regrets then about the way you 
have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your 
approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this 
experience?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like 
his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue 
to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, 
there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with 
them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this 
case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around 
a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.
	     
	     Q	  They're being denied any other legislative means of 
putting their proposals forward.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --
	     
	     Q	     any ideas.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being 
defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.
	     
	     Q	     to present them.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean 
they get the votes --
	     
	     Q	     that theirs can be passed though by the 
parliamentary rules under which they're playing.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in 
support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.
	     
	     Q	  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration 
backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?
	     
	     Q	     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for 
Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of 
grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at 
some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about 
anything recently.
	     
	     Q	     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the 
President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be 
some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the 
President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider 
something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President 
appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a 
special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around 
the California economic situation, including the situation in Los 
Angeles.  
	     
	     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles 
by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, 
Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD 
Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits 
by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I 
wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to 
California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is 
concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy 
decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities 
which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to 
watch it.
	     
	     Q	  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also 
supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a 
group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball 
management.  Does the President have a position on that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received 
correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson 
has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  
He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in 
baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the 
President intends to continue to go to the ball game.
	     
	     Q	  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see 
Reverend Jackson while he's out there?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see 
them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has 
raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said, 
even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.
	     
	     Q	  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball 
game?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe 
the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an 
informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to 
the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining 
his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the 
President read it.
	     
	     Q	  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the 
managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be 
there, and is he going to meet with the President?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.
	     
	     Q	  What is the Mubarak schedule?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is 
coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a 
lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice 
President Gore.
	     
	     Q	  And joint statements tomorrow --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, 
yes.
	     
	     Q	  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did 
warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist 
activities?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, 
I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been 
general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a 
long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I 
mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there 
was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  
The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also 
reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.
	     
	     Q	  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, 
apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, 
forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at 
the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in 
their attempts to get some kind of action.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would 
agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did 
say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a 
network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate 
action.  But there was no specific information on this specific 
operation at all.
	     
	     Q	  So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the 
law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have 
received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in 
not pursuing some kind of --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.
	     
	     Q	  What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing 
mention in the news conference yesterday --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your 
question.
	     
	     Q	  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted 
action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what 
does the U.S. do next?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going 
to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our 
allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways 
to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an 
agreement.
	     
	     Q	  George, why do you think sanctions is still an 
option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the 
leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait 
you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day 
said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any 
time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When 
does no mean no and you have to do something different?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something 
different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the 
U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to 
try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every 
opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.
	     
	     Q	  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? 
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something 
that is under consideration.
	     
	     Q	  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's 
condition, how he's doing?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.
	     
	     Q	  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think 
we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning 
after the Mubarak visit.
	     
	     Q	  Is he going somewhere for Easter?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.
	     
	     Q	  What more can you tell us about the additional aid 
to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with 
the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.  
I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their 
delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the 
Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the 
next several weeks.
	     
	     Q	  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude 
of the one announced Sunday?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the 
magnitude.
	     
	     Q	  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where 
do you stand on that --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday, 
he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week 
and reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this 
week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a 
hard look at it.
	     
	     Q	  But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White 
House involvement, Congress is compiling this list?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the 
congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll 
be able to get our own researchers working as well.
	     
	     Q	  George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a 
probability than a possibility?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under 
discussion.
	     
	     Q	  Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter 
of time and -- for months before that happens.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's 
something that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working

        EN ROUTE TO CAMDEN YARDS FOR ORIOLES OPENING DAY GAME
	     
                              MARC Train
                       En Route to Camden Yards



11:45 A.M. EDT
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson's 
protest today?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's an informational protest.  
I think it's fine.  The owners put out a statement few days ago, 
which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase 
minority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we 
should.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.  
And I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's 
a legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an 
informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to 
the game.  So, I think it's good.
	     
	     Q	  Do you think they're moving fast enough?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first 
step.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an 
issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to 
give it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will 
highlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate 
on the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break 
that and get cloture?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I 
mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one 
of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you 
know, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate 
the majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not 
like the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they 
can stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a 
lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote 
for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political 
pressure not to do it.  
	     
	     And, of course, what it means is that in this time when 
no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an 
economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're 
willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston 
and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very 
sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in 
a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans 
had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the 
program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots 
level, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they 
have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep 
Americans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.
	     
	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.

Why all the quote marks, Roy?  I can see that they might be appropriate where
there is a legitimate concern that the words are being distorted by context, 
or that they have been appropriated Newspeak-style, but, reading your comments above,
one might be excused if they assumed that you were claiming that "child abuse",
"forced" sexual activity, and "damage" caused by this is non-existant or
greatly overblown.

"Positive experiences", indeed!

Hmmm.  Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That means
third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consulting
a 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at 
21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks.
Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or
a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are
wrong.

By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad
prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as
California, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally 
stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law, 
but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors,
willing to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was
terribly upset about this.

I remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a
clinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wondering
a bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice
doesn't have a grain of truth to it.

Perhaps, though the exclusion of the Gay Perotistas in the
SF Gay Pride Parade would make me think that they had some
clue in this regard.  Dozens of examples?  I don't know...

Thank you for correcting the error in my post to the net.
This information came from a newspaper article that was
fuzzy in my mind.  I can only wonder if there have been
similar outcries about NAMBLA's presence in the parades
of New York and Boston.

And I was pointing out that legal precedent defines a human being as
referring only to the born, so your suggestion was incorrect.

There is a confusion here about what "bodily resources" constitutes.  Blood
transfusions and organ donations involve bodily resources; your examples
do not.

OK, I should have said "former" enemy.  I was being sarcastic about what

Could we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of a
gun?

Have you considered a non-interventionist policy?  If market reform does
happen, Russia will certainly get *private* capital at *private* risk to
help their economy.  They will even have incentive to do so for the same
reason.  If they don't reform, then our government will probably
consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help
them.

Then their's the ideological point.  We want to "win" Russia over to
our type of government -- a type where the rulers can rule without limit
over everyone's finances?

It seems instead of gridlock on any scale, we have aid to Russia,
expensive space programs, national charity that doesn't help the poor,
and probably, studies of drunken goldfish.  I think *limited* government
is more key than how democratic it is.

That was an opinion, and libertarians are very big on free speech.

If you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you should
be VERY libertarian.  Consider it a compromise.  How much money would
your fellow Russia-aiders have to give to Russia if those you oppose
weren't using the same government machine to steal money from you
and your group for causes you don't support?

   An addition to anti-discrimination laws which includes homo and bisexuality
? One would assume it would be because politicians were listening to the people
coming up with rational arguments rather than variations on bigotry. Logic
sometimes prevails.
   BTW, glad to see that you've admitted sexual attraction to children is a
seperate sexual orientation. Didn't think you had that much honesty.

He'd have to go a far ways to run things down as bad as Reagan and Bush 
did.  We didn't have riots but Bush got dumped out on his spotty Behind.


We'll see in 4 years.

But you still get into trouble. For example - how often are crimes
of violence not "hate crimes"? The question is then who are you
hating? If its another gang member, then its better than if
the person you hate is of a differnt color? 

Also, is it realistic to declare that crimes of hate are worse
than crimes of gross negligence? (Like random drive by shootings
where they can't be hate crimes because the shooter doesn't know
who he is going to hit - he just shoots into the crowd).

First, I heard today that there is a good chance that the U.S. instead
of New York is going after the bombers. This means no capital punishment.

Secondly, double jepardy does help keep the government from going after
you for first one murder, then the next, etc. A "sovereign" has essentially
one chance with a single fact pattern (such as the World Trade Center bombing).
That is why the bombers will in all probability be tried for all the
deaths, as well as the property damages, as well as conspiracy, at once.
Of course, as we discovered in the Rodney King case, there are two
"sovereigns", neither of which can try you twice for the same crime.

Why don't you compare the rates at which blacks and whites commit crimes?
Blacks commit crimes disproportionately, so in a perfectly fair penal
system, blacks would be disproportionately represented.

(Note: black vs. white crime rates is not a racial thing.  It's probably
an economic thing: poor people are more likely to commit crimes, and blacks
are more likely to be poor.  The way to reduce the proportion of minorities
in prison is to increase the wealth of minorities.)

{Interesting that you would respond "emotionally" in defense of the 
government. Maybe there is a beating heart there.}

For the record though, the biggest-baddest goverment on earth claims 
the most sovereignty over man. Best I can tell God allows anyone to
go to hell who wants to. Omnipotency logically determines that "allowing"
and "sending" mean the same thing.  (Mere human concepts of course.)

So come on WDS. Why bother to try some flimsy facade of logic. Waco
proves it's not needed -- the demonstration that government can walk
over it's own rules in the name of justice has been made. No problem 
by me. Noted and announced -- for the record. Just giving the govern-
ment it's due, and getting back to more worthwhile non-government 
concerns.

                  Office of the Press Secretary
                 (Vancouver, British Columbia) 
______________________________________________________________


                       BACKGROUND BRIEFING
                               BY
                 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS


                          April 4, 1993
	     
                          Canada Place
                  Vancouver, British Columbia  


9:40 A.M. PST
	     
	     
	     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING 
on the aid package.

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The 
President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed 
yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic 
and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  

	     Before taking your questions and running through the 
basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  
First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do 
with available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds 
have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is 
no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund 
any of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently 
are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin 
tomorrow.
	     
	     The second point is that this package is designed to 
support Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package 
are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have 
been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian 
government.
	     
	     Third, the President is determined that we will 
deliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed 
to maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we 
wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we 
feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in 
front of you.
	     
	     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of 
trade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's 
capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend 
well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of 
governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do 
so.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make 
trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  
	     
	     They also agreed that there would be a new joint 
commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by 
Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through 
the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote 
a vastly expanded relationship.
	     
	     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down 
the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just 
give you some general background on what these programs are.  
I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.
	     
	     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food 
and medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has 
been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian 
grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure 
there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the 
major cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food 
for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also 
be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and 
pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.
	     
	     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you 
know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship 
with Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia 
that we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the 
Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  
The value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are 
concessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, 
but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on 
principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates 
thereafter for the life of the deal.
	     
	     The third program is a collection of private sector 
support.  We think this is one of the most important things we're 
going to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses 
is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  
And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American 
enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the 
goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in 
Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  
	     
	     The President has also decided to create a 
privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian 
government in its priority objective of trying to convert state 
enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has 
also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a 
Eurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by 
prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.
	     
	     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary 
page is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that 
this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of 
pursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total 
of $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed 
tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're 
launching.  
	     
	     The President is also calling for the development of 
a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to 
try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public 
efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in 
Russia.
	     
	     The fifth program you see is Russian office of 
resettlement.  This is a new initiative created and 
conceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration 
project.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military 
to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic 
states and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to 
make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's 
with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American 
construction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration 
basis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working 
very closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say 
that we have a long-term commitment to this project.  
	     
	     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They 
are two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our 
initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the 
possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and 
gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in 
the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much 
environmental damage.
	     
	     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, 
about the new group being created that the Vice President will 
chair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing 
with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development 
committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, 
to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede 
trade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time 
investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this 
problem full-time.  
	     
	     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and 
investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an 
analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we 
just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a 
commitment within our own government to have people work on it -- 
senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly 
important.
	     
	     You'll notice that the United States is going to 
support Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer 
status.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested 
our advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the 
long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is 
paramount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are 
supporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting 
their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  
	     
	     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in 
credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended 
$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil 
project.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an 
agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion 
framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance 
Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. 
We think this is a very important development.  We think we'll 
get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo 
conference, the G-7 conference.
	     
	     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to 
defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance 
objectives with you.
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major 
unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts 
in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and 
secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory 
under the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   
Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important 
agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding 
to three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 
million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement 
program.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for 
bomber dismantlement -- $130 million.
	     
	     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for 
the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed 
from the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially 
contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the 
construction of that storage facility.  
	     
	     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help 
in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear 
materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we 
add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance 
which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall 
safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety 
measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the 
last couple of years.  
	     
	     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more 
work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, 
and Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last 
couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for 
safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian 
territory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of 
START I, an agreement to accede to NPT. 
	     
	     So we are working very hard with all the parties to 
the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with 
them.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia 
as a very important step in that process.
	     
	     Q	  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in 
Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with 
Kazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the 
same one, why do you feel it's necessary?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same 
deal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil 
field.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights 
oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced 
today.  So it's completely new.
	     
	     Q	  Can you tell us more about what's involved?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like 
other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do 
two things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west 
Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating 
oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  
The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the 
natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which 
will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what 
Russia needs.
	     
	     So we think this deal is very, very good development 
for Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an 
American company.  And the American government has played a 
leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility 
in OPIC and through the loan guarantee.
	     
	     Q	  So it's to search and also to renovate fields 
that are already there?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.
	     
	     Q	  On that point, should other American companies 
expect to get administration support for such deals, or should 
they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 
billion?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, 
Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the 
U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department 
and the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we 
think it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, 
there will be $2 billion in financing available for American 
companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.
	     
	     Q	  That should take up all of the rest of the 
deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be 
support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a 
tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas 
companies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and 
gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will 
soak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may 
even extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.
	     
	     Q	  What's the current year budget costs of that 
$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any 
current year budget costs --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer 
you to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.
	     
	     Q	  The concessional food sales -- is there any 
current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in 
which the payments are due?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional 
food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  
USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to 
expend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd 
refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.
	     
	     Q	  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?
	     
	     Q	     and the private sector -- how many folks are 
going to be involved in that?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start 
with the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt 
coming into office that there were literally thousands of 
organization, private organizations in the United States that in 
one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve 
democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  
And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that 
had a variety of programs in this area.  And so the 
administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try 
to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give 
some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the 
efforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.
	     
	     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will 
soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in 
the former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might 
use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of 
our own government, but the resources of the American private 
sector and schools and communities across the nation.
	     
	     Q	     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word 
yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated 
besides the $300 million the President talked about?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration 
is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What 
the President has done this weekend is to consult really 
intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional 
measures the United States could take in some of these areas to 
support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he 
returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other 
ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.
	     
	     Q	  Two questions about the $700 billion 
agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of 
consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  
So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you 
explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans 
for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit 
into that situation?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the 
United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains 
and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think 
between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history 
here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through 
the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle 
to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of 
last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on 
that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and 
therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that 
program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and 
other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we 
could promote American grain sales.  
	     
	     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've 
announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the 
Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient 
authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked 
for a concessional loan program.  
	     
	     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a 
short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but 
a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what 
this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are 
worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of 
principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the 
life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of 
interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we 
believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal 
for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments 
and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this 
very important grain relationship, which is important for them, 
and it's important for the American farm community.
	     
	     Q	  I gather from what you say that this could make 
it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC 
loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, 
is that right? 
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit 
about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  
the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program 
because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you 
know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around 
$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having 
taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American 
market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to 
respond to a specific request from the Russian government for 
major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the 
grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, 
we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to 
great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with 
the Russian government and arrived at this solution.  
	     
	     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides 
them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on 
the short-term payments.
	     
	     Q	  Where do those funds actually come from?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the 
Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's 
authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do 
not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want 
to make that general point again:  Everything in this package, 
the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been 
allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration 
can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very 
important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, 
that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be 
able to do so.
	     
	     Q	  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 
million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually 
have a range from 0 to --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason 
for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us 
that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and 
harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the 
shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the 
harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the 
same level of food imports from the West.
	     
	     Q	  I would imagine there's going to be some 
considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other 
republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  
Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for 
the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with 
some of the other republics?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very 
conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending 
American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet 
Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the 
area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that 
you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and 
roughly 50 percent to the other countries. 
	     
	     In the area of food sales, we have been active with 
Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We 
will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this 
summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the 
other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are 
productive and they're hard-hitting.
	     
	     Q	  Has anything happened at the summit to lead 
American energy companies and other companies to believe that 
Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of 
taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our 
primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not 
only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd 
like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're 
convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to 
support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of 
Western governments have the financial resources over the next 
decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private 
sector can do that.  
	     
	     We look at our own society and we see tremendous 
capability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very 
good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial 
investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new 
technology and new capital to finance new production.  
	     
	     That's what the Russian government has told us it 
wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis 
on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on 
the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently 
last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President 
Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong 
signal to the American business community that we support their 
efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-
Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to 
support them.
	     
	     Q	  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to 
deliver on making Russia a more --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I 
would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. 
Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas 
sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice 
President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the 
barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil 
and gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that 
committee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to 
the work.
	     
	     Q	  What type of mechanism is already in place to 
administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will 
the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of 
the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the 
Russian government for distribution at their will?
	     	    
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking 
about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the 
program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working 
through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure 
that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to 
the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the 
Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can 
account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of 
months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of 
these programs.
	     
	     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in 
the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it 
is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of 
the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working 
through Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the 
housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, 
we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the 
democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian 
private individuals and private foundations.  We're working with 
journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have 
noticed.
	     
	     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different 
activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be 
carried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the 
Russian government, some with Russian citizens.
	     
	     Q	  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and 
on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the 
President has to do on that?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George 
noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in 
the relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's 
fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we 
return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and 
we'll get back to the Russian government.
	     
	     Q	  You were not prepared for these questions when 
you got here?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared 
for these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not 
prepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --
let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require 
consultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with 
the American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those 
concerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before 
we take any action.
	     
	     Q	  Is this package designed so that you will not 
have to go to Congress for anything at this point?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the 
beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all 
the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  
So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to 
seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In 
effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the 
agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And 
that's the advantage of this particular initiative.
	     
	     Q	  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, 
long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment 
heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to 
Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are 
prepared to go to Congress for various things?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been 
clear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with 
President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American 
funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a 
major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by 
Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that 
delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  
And we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where 
it stands now.
	     
	     Q	  We've been told repeatedly that a number of 
these items represent different or new ways of spending the money 
already appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these 
items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways 
that it was not previously set to be?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've 
said that these are all projects that either Congress had 
allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were 
some funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this 
administration took office and had some new ideas about how the 
funds might be expended.
	     
	     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or 
the FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --
Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to 
further our programs.
	     
	     And example of that is the Food for Progress 
concessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of 
funding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we 
looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American 
market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we 
found it.
	     
	     Q	  Where, for example, are you getting the money 
for this Russian officer resettlement --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the 
Freedom Support Act funds.
	     
	     Q	  In other words, all of the money is being 
directly spent in new ways, so to speak --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant 
projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the 
second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if 
you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that 
total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act 
funding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year 
'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the 
legislative history of those funds.
	     
	     Q	     cooperation --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I 
don't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.
	     
	     Q	  Could you tell us please, has anything happened 
here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and 
Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's 
happened here --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, 
President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this 
issue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security 
and arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's 
session.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly 
reinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been 
talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple 
of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the 
discussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very 
important negotiation that's been going on essentially between 
Moscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially 
discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute 
to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  
	     
	     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, 
I don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.
	     
	     Q?	    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is 
any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current 
year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been 
earmarked and put it into this fund?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and 
mirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We 
could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included 
out-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to 
many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the 
privatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already 
talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  
	     
	     We could have put in really big numbers and this 
could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  
This package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're 
going to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President 
feels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy 
that the western governments, the combination of governments, put 
up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not 
able to meet them, we're determined, and the President is 
determined, to carry out every single program in this package.  
And we'll do it.  
	     
	     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's 
part of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking 
for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively 
support reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment 
on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.
	     
	     Q	     taken it way from any --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  
Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; 
so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in 
Russia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.
	     
	     Q	  In terms of funding, there is no available 
monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money 
somewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I 
don't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the 
example is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit 
guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay 
back within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt 
problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we 
looked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement 
for grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and 
also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers 
have a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply 
look for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative 
authority to do it.  This program has been successful in other 
areas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, 
but we thought we should now.
	     	  
	     Q	  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package 
for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by 
initiatives put forward by President Bush?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think 
that's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were 
appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This 
administration took office and inherited some obligations that 
the Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven 
week review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments 
that had been made by the previous administration.  
	     
	     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the 
enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not 
been filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to 
it.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them 
into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, 
is another Clinton initiative.  
	     
	     Further, we listened to the Russian government and 
listened to the Russian military who told us that the 
resettlement of their officers was important to them for 
political and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton 
has responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment 
that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out 
a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  
	     
	     I would also say that the President has given 
impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly 
about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we 
have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends 
itself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the 
creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, 
we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private 
sector as well as the American government, to achieve that 
objective.  
	     
	     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And 
as most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the 
last administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last 
administration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton 
assistance package for Russia.
	     
	     Q	  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the 
past has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this 
outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money 
will not just disappear because it's being administered by the 
Russian government?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I 
know that the President and other senior officials of our 
government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and 
that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's 
intended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the 
State Department will take great care in making sure that the 
funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their 
source.
	     
	     I would not that this package is not simply a 
package of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of 
these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are 
going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, 
with businesses.  The private enterprise support is another 
example of that.
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add 
a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one 
area that we've been looking at very, very closely is 
consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting 
for these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, 
of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime 
contractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of 
a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that 
funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in 
Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent 
efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.
	     
	     Q	  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly 
when do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President 
is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think 
it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over 
the next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties 
on May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over 
the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach 
out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us 
to help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said 
that we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate 
in a much more effective way the activities of our own 
government.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in 
Russia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw 
them together and to focus their efforts.
	     
	     Q	  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will 
actually be spent in the United States by American made goods?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any 
figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something 
up in the next couple of days on that.
	     
	     Q	  This figure is larger than the figure that has 
been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result 
of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --
unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and 
I'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put 
us to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was 
briefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the 
intellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of 
the ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we 
had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have 
been refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week 
going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in 
Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  
And so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been 
together for about two weeks.
	     
	     Q	  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There 
was so much talk before about the President wanted to get 
Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  
Is that in the out years?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  
President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, 
that support for the creation of private businesses is important 
to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is 
important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize 
the state industries is important to them.  
	     
	     And so what we did was to try to make those the 
centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We 
listened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been 
working with the Russian government for months on this trying to 
work out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of 
these programs was involved every step of the way.  
	     
	     But let me get at the other part of your question.  
The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader 
set of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking 
for his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the 
table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in 
housing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to 
consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other 
allied governments that are also active.
	     
	     Q	  There's essentially nothing that happened in 
the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that 
you came in with?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular 
package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks 
ago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on 
the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've 
primarily talked about future, about what more the United States 
and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, 
which is our base objective here.
	     
	     Q	  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated 
to train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me 
what about job training for workers who are displaced by 
privatization?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we 
have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and 
financial services in the United States.  Part of the housing 
initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain 
Russian officers who are retiring into other professions.
	     
	     Q	     money for job training for workers whose 
jobs are disappearing because of privatization --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet 
allocated any money for that.
	     
	     Q	  Why not?
	     
	     Q	     of the $6 million is going to build 450 
housing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the 
Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do 
housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework 
of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've 
got to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think 
about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also 
retraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming 
out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  
We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers 
as well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian 
government.
	     
	     Q	     of the $6 million will go to retrain --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.
	     
	     Q	  Are you talking about apartment buildings or 
single --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about 
single, individual dwellings.
	     
	     Q	  You're saying that only 450 families will be 
served by this?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I 
thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  
What we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the 
Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building 
housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with 
a huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next 
couple of months and try to figure out with American 
organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job 
done.  
	     
	     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  
And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into 
this in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to 
spend the money wisely.
	     
	     Q	  What is it about this program that convinces 
you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be 
in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, 
especially considering their other debt problem?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think 
it's important to note that the United States on its own does not 
have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  
It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to 
our allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what 
the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We 
can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do 
so, which is consistent with our national interests.
	     
	     Q	  Did the President say that the value of the 
U.S. contribution was that it would create security and 
prosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this 
program that does this?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to 
go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, 
and that is we want to do everything we can to support the 
continuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay 
in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear 
forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, 
which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in 
Russia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that 
this program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we 
have to make a long-term commitment to it.
	     
	     Q	  And then on the question of Russia's ability to 
repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 
years from now?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian 
government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping 
is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve 
their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency 
revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years 
from now to pay back those loans.
	     
	     Q	     substantial government-to-government loan 
we've ever gotten into with the Russians?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to 
answer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years 
on this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because 
the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to 
just ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of 
effort.
	     
	     Q	     government loans in any other sector that 
you recall?  I know it wasn't done in --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair 
to say this is a new and unique effort.

Yes, sadly, this is true. The primary reason, and the essence of the
details that you are seeking, is that the Grahm-Rudman budget controls
were working.  In fact, they were working so well that unless the feds
did something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. So Bush
and the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced
Grahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush
"consented" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending
increases.

As it turned out, the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the caps
on spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act as
President (so that he could create his own new plan with more tax
increases).

The result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level 
ABOVE where it was when Reagan left office.

Chew on that awhile.

   I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling
himself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first
in the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal term
but may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotations
are quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the
eightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar
Max Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the
Nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is
synonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who
originally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans
and possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word
by Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is
nontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claim
to call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor-
shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.

  If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``In
search of the Indo-Europeans" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica.
The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature
as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and
for Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible
things done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have
no clear claim.

If a six year old child does a funny trick and you say well done he will
do it again and it may be funny. Then they may repeat it over and over
again bu you still have to pretend its funny even though it isn't any
more. Once they are older than six you expect them to realise that doing
the same thing over and over again isn't funny any more.

Basicaly Ed fails to be amusing because he is merely crass. He does not
make jokes that have any political content beyond attempting to ridicule
their target. Calling someone Slick Willie is not funny even if you put
on a red nose while you say it, it was a good debating point used on the
spur of the moment 12 months ago but now its use merely demonstrates that the
user couldn't think of anything original to say.


In the UK there is a tradition of old retired Colnels who bore the dinner
guests rigid with their descriptions of old campagns. Ed is clearly one
of this type of people who fails to see when a joke is spent.

Note that the laws that don't agree with you were passed to protect
a class of people who couldn't get justice from the state courts;
specifically civil rights workers in Missisippi in the 60's. The 
federal protection of individual rights supersedes the non-feasance
of the state. Something similar has long been traditional ( well
he's queer so I beat him up...) for gays

As Anatole France said; "The law in its impartial majesty forbids the
rich as well as the poor from sleeping under bridges."

Equality of law can be construed in any number of ways. For example
the fact that all property thefts, regardless of value, are not
punished equally is an inequality which protects those who have
a lot of money from having it stolen. You could easily define
equality to regard the property in terms of it's significance
for the owner. This would a form of equality that would be skewed
toward poorer people.

In fact, most anti-gay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal 
protection. They make it an offense to damage people based on a 
motivation of hatred for sexual orientation. Thus the law in its
impartial majesty protects hets as well as gays from being bashed.
I'm sure that's a great relief to Douglas Meier.

To answer your irrelevant question, yes a person of color is human,
but I still don't know what you mean by human being and you have
merely begged the question without responding.  By trying to inject
the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without
adding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could
be "Is a polydactyl person a human being?"  You still have not
answered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.

You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies.
If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on
the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule,
provide it for me.

More irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law
has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does
not follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out,
brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights
of the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant
difference.

What I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that
you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the
thread you started?  You got answers to your questions when
you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some
ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected,
changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion
of substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance,
why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss
silly accussations, e.g. "It really doesn't matter to you..."
If it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek
some substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person
of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic
and show some meaning to your words.

As others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on
which has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy
fails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here.
A woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore
my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would
not be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?

You simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is
not accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on
for size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill
the other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments.
But the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the
other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The
systems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling
to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.

Your argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total
failure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in
reality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert
that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible,
that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said,
you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one
hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than
a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins
murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each
other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe
in now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions
are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where
they cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said,
there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim
that is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a
claim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to
its claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?

You haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.

Again you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and
it is not as slow as you seem to think.

Yes, and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that
he was murdered by a religious, "pro-life" fanatic.  Please do
try to stay relevant.

What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake?
Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her
kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What
is different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this
out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one
case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born
child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus
can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference
between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at
stake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are
irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction
anyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have
borne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a
healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as
she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at
parties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and
the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary
than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.

Cite one of these conflicting statutes.  You keep making
these assertions, but you haven't supported any of them yet.
I am speaking of statutes that conflict with the definition
Larry posted.

Why did you delete the code that Larry posted?

Also, the Model Penal Code made perfect sense to me.  Were you,
perhaps, confused by it?

Also, I am still looking for your definition.  The one you used
clearly indicates that a fetus is not a human being.

Circular arguments are usually very consistent.

Again, your desire for consistency disappears when it does not suit
your needs.  The principle of protecting life is abandoned based
on "action versus inaction."  Not much of a principle.  Suddenly
you recognize that the claim on bodily resources is dependent
on circumstances other than this principle of life.  That's
a very conevnient principle you have there, Matt.

Yes because it has always had that power. The constitution limits the areas
in which the government can exercise power. The constitution can be changed
however and has been frequently. For example during prohibition the 
government had no power to permit alcohol to be sold although the state had
the capacity to change the constitution to enable this.

The constitutional provisions are merely a matter of form that dictate
the manner in which power is exercised. No piece of paper can prevent
abuse, for example the imprisonment of the socialist presidential candidate
for opposing world war I - a clear breach of the first ammendment,

The United States clearly has the capacity to bring in meaningful arms
control measures. If there were large groups of powerful warlords who could
prevent such a measure by force we would have to admit that the power
of the federal government to uphold the constitution was limited. This
is the situation in Somalia where the state is unable to govern because
the people with the guns think that they have the right to decide the
law.

The problem is extrapolating from our notions of what a state is which
date from the treaty of Westphalia to the medieval period where countries
were much more analogous to bodies like the EEC or the UN - organisations
where individual members had significant powers in their own right and
did not derive their power from a central authority.

But here we are not talking of a time where law was voluntary. The rules
and regulations settled in this manner were in areas that the state 
was not involved in. Even today a great deal of law is effectively
made in this manner. For example the city of London stockmarket which is
a non governmental body that can make and enforce rules. It does so however
within the framework laid down by the government.

In medieval times this framework existed in preciosely the same manner. If
you were to set up shop as a trade association and decide to screw the
monarch you could expect to end up inside the tower in a very short
time. Most of the organisations allowed to make law have explicit Royal
Charters, such as the Universities for example. Fairs and towns all required 
authority in order to trade. It was customary however for this authority
to be granted on a permanent basis subject to revocation in the case of
misbehavior. After Magna Carta the monarch lost the power to remove
privillage without recourse to the courts. Tony Benn recently established
through a devious route the power of the Parliament to revoke favours
without recourse to the courts - thus establishing the right to abolish
the house of lords for example.

Certainly none of the rules set up by merchants forms any part of the 
"common law" which has a very specific meaning in the UK. It is law
made by the judiciary through judgements on cases. Nothing else is
common law.


Incidentaly the common law is a lot more common than people expect. For
example a judgment in common law made in England can effect the 
interpretation of the law in most of the countries that were once in
the Empire, including the US, the reverse is also true. For example a
lot of the decisions surrounding AIDS cases in the US are of relevance
to UK decisions. Although the statues are different the reasoning that
lies behind the interpretation of those statues is common and thus if
a judge made a reasoned assesment of the interpretation of the law in
one jurdisdiction it would clearly be perverse if another country with no
guiding precedent should judge a person to be guilty of a crime which
they might by the existence of a precedent consider to be legal. The law
should be as predictable as possible and abhors making decisions without
precedent. Once a decision is made in the UK though that naturally is 
superior in UK law.

     In case you missed it on the news....the first 16 Haitians
of many that tested positive for HIV and were being held on a
base in Cuba have been flown to the U.S.
     Further a U.S. judge has ruled that they must receive
medical treatment or be returned to a place where they could
receive same.

      So guess what folks, we taxpayers get to pick up the tab 
(just as you might have expected) for people who have never
contributed a dime to the U.S. society.

      I think this government has its priorities ALL SCREWED UP.
If they want to help Haitians....how about removing the illegal
government, how about giving them development aid?
IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE to waste resources on dying non-citizens
who will never be productive in either this country or their own.
It does not make sense when the same resources applied or even
just plain given to poor people in Haiti could significantly
help 100 people in Haiti per 1 AIDS-infected non-citizen immigrant.

He is claiming that what the Indonesians are up to in East Timor is genocide.

Certainly what is going on is serious enough that it is way above the threshold
where it should be brought to attention. Pol Pot did not kill nearly as many
people as Hitler but he is most certainly as evil.

He fully accepts the differences in the intentions and situations. What he
is saying is that the effect in both cases has been mass murder only we
only get to hear about the one that supports the red scare merchants and the
behaviour of our allies is conveniently ignored.

A starker comparison is in El Salvador where the allegations that the left
were repeatedly making throughout the 1980s have been proven with the 
discovery of mass graves. There was evidence enough at the time that Duarte
and his gang of thugs were mass murderers but Regan and Bush ignored it
and gave them arms to repress the opposition. This must be contrasted with
the events in Nica<ragua where no evidence of Sandinista attrocities such
as mass murder of political opponents has come to light since they lost
the democratic elections that they held. Despite this the Nicaraguan regime
was held to justify the funding of a terrorist war fought mainly against
civillians by the infamous contras.

In order of your questions, I oppose it, I oppose it, I oppose it and
(Huh?  Wha?  Where did _that_ topic come from and what's it got to do
with the discussion at hand? :-)

When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes
against different classes of people (and yes, I do consider laws which
allow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the
convict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit
into that category), the category of classes I had in mind was that of
the standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender,
ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.  Having you ask about
classes based upon one's _profession_ rather than one's personal
characteristics caught me off guard, and I had to think out the question
from scratch.

What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize such
classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare
some people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathema
to the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.

Last year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would
have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plus
crimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not
protected by that "aura of deterrence," critics pointed out the
absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the
murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a
civilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much more
valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society.
This was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents of
that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge
some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their
"contribution to society."  I view that doctrine as being both (a)
personally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the Equal Protection clause of
the 14th Amendment.

Accordingly, I believe that there should be no laws which give any
profession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanism
of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of
that class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-ranking
members of the Executive Branch of the federal government.

And when controlled for usage of oil, gas, etc. energy efficiency in
all countries turns out to be identical :-)

To take population density as an example, one way to reduce energy
used in transportation is surely to concentrate the population in
dense urban areas (though this might, of course, have other
disadvantages, possibly even relating to energy use).  The fact that
Japan is forced to do this by the nature of the country, while the US
is not, does not mean that people in the US would be unable to do this
if given sufficient motive to conserve energy.

Which provided the basis for the denoument of the film which
introduced Errol Flynn to the world.  (Love interest was Olivia de
Havilland, who went on to appear with Flynn in 7 more films.)

Both events took place, but not as you described them. It feels trivial to
nit-pick about details like this, and insulting to everyone involved.
But I feel that the truth is more damning than an exaggeration, and
much more likely to cause people to think when they read it.

In general, when I read an argument that uses inaccurate and inflamatory
statements (honest mistake or not), I tend to dismiss the entire argument
because of those errors.

The entire situation in the Middle East is too important to reduce to
back-and-forth propaganda -- it is precisely this reduction that further
polarizes the situation and makes peace, understanding, and reconcilliation
impossible.

Agreed. It would have been better if both situations could have been avoided.

it may be a little late to reply to your tirade and also on an inaapropriate
board but along with all of the so called great things the white male has done they have also contributed to society by means of mass genocide, the theft of
ideas and cultures, creating and the perptration of historical lies throughouttime among many other horrible activities.
but every culture has its upside and its downside.  it seems to me that the 
white male (must be extremely ignorant to qualify for the following - if
you're not disregard) and western culture are the only things that look to 
actively classify things as good or bad, worthy or unworthy (ya dig)
it can be seen with slavery and the manipulation and destruction of the 
american indians civilization.  nothing but selfish acts that benefit one 
group of people (and not even their women get or got respected or regarded as
equal - ain't that some stuff)

white men - not being specific - but in a lot of cases are just wack or have
wack conceptions of how the world is to serve their purpose.  

just look at david koresh - throughout history (i may be shortsighted on this one so excuse my predjudiced ignorance) only white men associate themselves withbeing GOD.  no other culture is ignorant or arrogant enough to assume such a 
position.  and then to manipulate and mislead all those people.

hmmm...  i'd say look in your history books but since it seems that history 
has been written to glorify the exploits of white men you'd only find lies.

Which, considering the amount Bush&congress added to it, would be a
not-inconsiderable achievement.

While we're on the subject, I also believe that the supply-side claim that
reducing taxes raised revenue is also false, because they typically factor in
SocSec taxes, which were *raised* a considerable amount, at the same time that
income taxes were cut.  If you look at income tax revenue alone, it fell after
after the cuts began, and didn't recover for several years. By then, record
deficits were well entrenched.

	Ok, as far as that goes I agree.  The situatio in E. Timor does deserve
the attention that Bosnia, Angola, etc. get.  But...I also think that the
"press" can't be forced to print articles, air shows about it, etc.
	The religious right got tired of the mainstream media and started
buying their own stations/papers.  The left should do the same thing instead of
relying on NPR and public stations.

	I wouldn't venture that far (to say the situation in E. Timor is
genocide).  The Indonesians seem perfectly willing to not kill anyone who
doesn't get in their way: which is something the Khmer Rouge didn't do. 
Virtually everyone not in the Khmer Rouge suffered the "killing fields".
	(Once again, not to downplay the violence in Timor....)

	I don't agree.  Right now Australia is the most effective lever against
Indonesia.  They are negotiating for oil drilling rights off Timor, and
stopping that process would go a long way towards making Indonesia realize that
people don't want to see the situation swept under the rug.

	Would you please define "nth derivative of debt"?  Last time I asked
you seem to have disappeared....

	And it's the deficits themselves that came down to 2.9% of GNP.  The
numbers are posted in the previous posting.

	Cute, Paul, but with no numbers you still look foolish.

	Paul, like many others, is confusing the deficit with the debt.

	Not in terms of GNP, the one universally accepted measure of deficits
(at least among rigorous economists :)

Carlos,

   Why not check out some of the scientific research that has been
done in this area and convince yourself.

   Research around the world indicates that the issue of coercion is
the critical factor. 

For those interested in research on the topic I can suggest, Li et al
(England), Constantine (United States), and Sandfort (The Netherlands).
I especially like Sandfort's research for he actually quotes what the
boys who are involved in the relationships have to say.

If time is really hard, can a bank selectively call in some mortgage
loans early?  What if the bank folds, can its creditors call in the
loans?

...His account that is.

Many important issues, and some not-so important ones, are discussed here
on the net on a daily basis.  I have just been informed of what I feel is
one of the most important things that we could ever discuss -- The 
out-and-out censorship of one of our fellow posters because some people
don't like what he says or thinks.

We have all seen the postings here by AJ Teel.  Although many of us have
not agreed with their content, I'm sure most of us have been at least
somewhat interested in them.  I, for one, am greatful to live (I thought)
in a country where people like Mr. Teel are allowed to say what they please.
If I don't wan't to read it, I can just skip on by, or unsuscribe.  But,
unfortunately, some people cannot let others live and let live.  They feel
an overwhelming need to snuff out the little bastards.  Now it seems that
Mr. Teel will be with us no more, due mainly to our brother, and cheif
net police, Ted Frank.


PLEASE HELP AJ TEEL REGAIN NET (POST) ACCESS AND CORRECT THIS INJUSTICE. 

                      ARE YOU ON TED'S HIT LIST?  
                      ARE YOUR THOUGHTS CORRECT?  
                        IS YOUR ACCOUNT SAFE?
         HAS YOUR SYSADMIN BEEN CONTACTED BY THE THOUGHT POLICE?

I thought the NLG and the ACLU supported people with diverse opinions. NOT!

 
Please read the following forwarded messages from AJ Teel so that 
you may understand this vial act for what it is...

Subject: Officer Ted Frank, Thought Police Badge Number NWO-666
Summary: Ted wins the argument by killing his opponent!
Expires: 
Sender: "A. J. Teel, Sui Juris" (ajteel@dendrite.cs.Colorado.EDU)
Followup-To: alt.conspiracy
Distribution: 
Organization: University of Colorado, Boulder
Keywords: NWO Ted Frank

Well, well, well... Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) and
thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed.
I guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult
for them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my
sysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his
defense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has
been posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed
at me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding
via netmail...)

While I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin
to get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post
I made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not
what the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I
AM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him
axed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. "Argumentum
ad silence-your-opponent-um"?! I would have thought he would have
wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and
seem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).

The issue that seems to be: "Is the following an advertisement?"
Apparently, Ted and Mark think so...

1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken 
	*off the net* from last year. If reposting an article
	constitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post
	did have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one
	had posted the address and subscription price of "Newsweek",
	would that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff.
2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of
	"proof" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains
	to my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and
	behold, "poof", there goes my account. This one had an
	address in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!

If you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE
ITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send
a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get
"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful..." or whatever; they
only get "I don't like what that user is doing because...".
Please do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them
in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.

In my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying "Thanks for
the info" or "Could you send me such and such?" or "Your posts are
very interesting... keep it up." and only a handfull of "Go aways". But,
I guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to
convince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant
a message complaining about me. (Knock, knock..."My name is Ted and
and this is Mark... We're from the thought police. Seems you have
some pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them...")
NWO Indeed!

Guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with
a new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy.
I will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks!
Your comments and support are requested. I can no longer post
to news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit
from making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book. 
Seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side
shut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the
process of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that
a lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.
Oh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I
was just getting started.

It should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40
times of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the
contrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed?
We all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people
on the net that are of "interest" to the government, and Ted sure seems
to have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does
he work for? The University of Chicago which he "attends"(?) is well
known as one of the biggest NWO supporters...

And finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here
in the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the
process of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe
a TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Since I
am longer be able to post news and will no longer have email VERY
soon, I hope that anyone who wishes to contact me will do so via:

[Editor's Note: The reason for posting the header lines from the bounced
messages was to show what the problem was and hopefully correct it.]

[Ted Frank] It's inexcusable to post 150 lines of bounced mail headers to four
newsgroups.
    A simple four-line post would have been sufficient.

[Lazlo]
yes i agree. BUT our policy is to not watch everypost someone  here  
makes.
we generally let the net itself take care of inappropriate postings
by flaming the user into shape (which i assume this is ment to be).
we (CS operations) don't like to get involved in this stuff (unless
its illegal, repetitive posts of 1gig gifs, harassment, or something
else that offends the community in general). my suggestion is that
you take it to email and explain what a post for bounces should look  
like or tell him to RTFM

OK, I admit I have no hard data on this. Why don't you help me with this?
If you would compile a commented list of all grants, un-repaid loans (if any),
and direct aid, I'd be very interested to see it. If you could give me
references from, for example, Congressional Budget Authorization Hearings,
I could look them up here and I'd be happy to post a verification of your
data.

Otherwise, I'll try my hand at this, but unfortunately I won't have sufficient
time available until the end of this month, so the results would be delayed.

Let me know if you're interested in doing this.

And, as has been noted more times than we care to count, about as 
likely to stand up in court as the twenty-seven eight by ten 
color glossy pictures the Stockbridge, Mass., police, took for 
use as evidence against Arlo Guthrie.  (As anyone who knows 
Alice's Restaurant is aware, he pleaded guilty to littering, was 
fined $50, and told to pick up the garbage.)

HOW NOT TO WRITE A DEED

One case involved the construction of a conveyance to grantees "jointly, as 
tenants in common, with equal rights and interest in said land, and to the 
survivor thereof, in fee simple. . . . To Have and to Hold the same unto the 
said parties hereto, equally, jointly, as tenants in common, with equal rights 
and interest for the period or term of their lives, and to the survivor thereof 
at the death of the other."

The court held that the survivorship provision indicated an intent to create a 
joint tenancy.  Germain v. Delaine, 294 Ala. 443, 318 So.2d 681 (1975).

   Probably because you have yet to respond to the refutation I've posted.
   Teel, it's bad enough you post this bs, it's even worse that you don't
   even try to defend it when it gets torn to pieces, but then posting
   that no one's looked at it and gloating when all facts point to the
   contrary point to a severely deluded mind.

What I found interesting about Conklin's letter is the 
6 cases he has won against the IRS.  Now, assuming that
these cases really exist and were one by him (anyone checked?)
they may have nothing to do with his major tax claim.  The IRS fought
one of his deductions.   Defending your deductions seems puny when
you believe that there is no need to file in the first place!

Your statement is a common misconception, but it just isn't true. In the
German Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the
largest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and
generally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective
majority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose to
the Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false
as well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January
1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by
Hitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 election
for President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg
49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff election
in April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%.
So we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of
German voters.

Similarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote in
Reichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 election
the Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out of
the 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and the
Communists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German National
party, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a million
of the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other large
party was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had but
I think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties.
Thus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointed
Chancellor.

What brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people for
Hitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties to
put their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government
for the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, and
their parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the
interests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was a
number of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific
objectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end the
democratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the other
parties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were also
out to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, and
generally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.

Germany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalition
for five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, and
there certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis.
If anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed
to get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote had
begun to decline.

Hitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even his
second choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. After
the November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailed
on von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his back
and support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher,
who became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to hold
together a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused to
participate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some of
the Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in the
party at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others,
knowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gain
power lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the country
was governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even though
the Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men to
achieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition
parties to work together.

Here's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_:

   The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their
   failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength,
   in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of
   the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their
   opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine
   against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm
   them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.

True, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor. But
that doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him
*before* he was in power. The German people were not crying out for Hitler to
take over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. The leftist parties
(Socialists/Communists) probably had more support in total than the Nazis.
Hitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see
the government paralyzed as a means to taking it over.

The fact is that Primetime (TM of ABC) has had numberous reposts on such waste
programs that already exist.  Again, if we are truely intrested in eliminating
the DEBT, we must REMOVE the DEFICIT, and do away with ALL PORK !!!

There have been several books written on gov. waste, network news programs 
from time to time devote segments to this, and there have been bills proposed
that significantly reduces expenditures without touching external programs by 
changing the way 'congress does business' (and make it more efficent).

True, blame is easy, but also is spending someone else's money.  

Clinton ran on a platform that he would '...not raise taxes on the middle class
to pay for these (his) programs'.  He has proposed a program that is not 
specific, that counts on tax hikes to pay for.

Tsk. Surely you don't wish for the Democrats to destroy our beloved country
just so your party can get some trivial political advantage? That's rather
a petty way to think. (Not that this pettiness doesn't extend all the way
to the U.S. Senate, I've noticed...)

While Bush was president, I kept hoping and praying that he'd wise up. I
couldn't stand the man, but I wish he'd done a decent job; if so, we might
not be in the mess we are now, and that would be a small price to pay for
suffering through another term of Republican control. Similarily, YOU should
be hoping and praying that Clinton does a good job. Even if you're certain
he won't.

If we had backed him strongly early on I doubt there would be the
problem there is now.  Many Russians became disillusioned with democracy
and reforms when they felt, rightly IMO, that the West didn't care.

Yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid (once Bush got over his
Gorby-mania.)  This probably kept him from dismantling the congress
and calling for new elections.  Well, the aid didn't come through
and we didn't make sure it went to the proper places and now the
anti-reformers are gaining strength where before they were in
hiding.

If they don't reform I don't believe in giving them money.  However,
I think this is too important to take a non-interventionist approach.

Despite the wishes of Libertarians, this society is a far way, and getting
farther, from being Libertarian.  Perhaps voluntary gifts would work if
we had the proper framework but we do not have it.  We have to face the
problem *now*, not in X years when we have a Libertarian dream society.

Right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade, let alone charity.
There are still limitations to high-tech exports.  NASA can't buy
Proton launch vehicles from them.  Sure, the market may be able to
help a great deal but it can't right now.  There are too many obstacles.
Instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to 
tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face.

Well, I think limited government is primarily democratic due
to it being limited.  But the main question is how do you transform
a state-run economy and monolithic government into something that
even remotely looks like ours?  (BTW, sometimes it seems that our government 
is trying to go the opposite direction)  It is not going to be
painless and not going to be easy.  We simply cannot wait to
help when they *have* the 'proper' government.  They'll never
get there without the aid.  It may be too late already.

As I also said above, another problem I have is with *transformation*.
A Libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight.
I have seen nothing about how to take our current government and
society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible
self-sufficient populace.

Yes, depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses.  Rulers
do emerge *somewhere* and they will never represent the opinions of
every person on the planet.  

There must be checks and balances.  Checks on the government when
it gets out of bounds and checks on industry when it gets out of
bounds.  Putting all your hopes on the benevolence of the market
is, to me, just like putting all your hopes on the benevolence of
government.

Wait a minute.  You've been claiming for quite a while now that
pedophilia, according to CA state law, is a sexual orientation.  Now
your position is that the law doesn't specifically exclude it?

You know damn well what's going to happen.  Some guy in a NAMBLA
T-shirt's going to apply at a day-care, they're going to turn him down,
he's going to take it to court, and the court's going to rule that
sexual orientation is defined as homosexuality, heterosexuality, or
bisexuality.

Unless and until that court decides that pedophilia is a sexual
orientation, you have no business saying so.

There's no "for purposes of this act, the term 'sexual orientation' will
be defined as" section?  No definitions anywhere?  Did they run this
through the state Congress on an accelerated schedule or something?

I was not discussing "universal" definitions in this post, Mark. Please

Do you agree with my statement above about physicians being unqualified if
they can't determine viability?

And that's good enough for the law, Mark. So why do you keep whining that
viability "isn't defined"? What purpose does your whining serve?

The economic and political ignorance of most Americans can be truly scary.
Price controls and government intervention.  The surest route to
disaster.  It's amazing, people never seem to learn from history (or
common sense).  Price controls do not, and cannot work.  I would have
thought our last experiment in the 70's would have been enough to 
dampen the belief that price controls can actually work.  As for
government intervention, people never seem to get the irony of what
the are saying.  We are told that entitlements are the biggest portion
of the budget and they must be 'controlled'.  We are presented with
horror stories of waste and fraud in almost all government agencies.
We are shown stories about the miserable treatment our veterans get
in our government run hospitals.  We are just now seeing stories about
how Social Security isn't going to cut it in the future (as if that
should come as any surprise).  And yet, people choose to ignore all
of that and believe in the fairy tale of the government coming to
the rescue.  Simply amazing.

Some of the footage shown on "Street Stories" the other night 
showed an ATF agent screaming at the cameraman to "get that 
camera out of here" while they were in retreat from the "compound".
I think the same person may have also said to "turn the camera off".
Anyway, it was clear from the comments that the safety of the
cameraman wasn't their paramount concern.

If the heading is true, Mr. Frank should be ashamed of himself.

Nothing makes me gag more than people who don't respect the
rights of others to voice their opinions.  My idol Lenny Bruce
once commented about "that asshole Time Magazine" when they
advocated censorship of his material.  Time actually sided
with the cops' and their arresting of Bruce at his shows,
whereby he routinely would say "cocksucker", then the cops
would rush the stage to arrest him.  My, how the times haven't
changed...

I can't help but think of how Lenny would be received in today's
politically correct arena.  Heck, I even support the right of
neo nazis to speak their opinions and march down the streets.

And before Mr. Frank or anyone else makes any wisecracks about
anti-Semitism...I'm Jewish, a longtime member of AIPAC and the JNF,
and have contributed over $1000 apiece to these fine groups.  I'm
a regular contributor to every pro-Israel group I can find, but I
still support the right of people like Arf to speak up and vomit
his propaganda.

I want to know just WHO these people are !!!

I'm basing all this on the assumption that Mr. Frank did indeed
write to some sysadmin requesting Mr. Teel to be admonished.  If
this is not the case, I hereby retract these nasties directed
toward him.  If not, I stand against Mr. Frank and his trashing
of the First Amendment.

Once more around the racetrack. See the original statement that it is
nonsense to believe that you cannot legislate morality. I simply stated
that they can pass all the laws they want but not a single one of them
will make you or I more moral people. They may make us act in a moral
manner, but our actions are only a reflection of the unwillingness to
risk punishment. They say nothing about whether we have become more
moral or not. Perhaps the distinction is too fine.

I have the right to live there UNDER the established
government, right?  Exactly.  Thus, the Palestinian Arabs
should be content to live under Israeli rule, but should cease
clamoring for an independent state.  OR, they should get one in
Gaza and, if it can be worked out, part of the West Bank.  This
is what I have proposed all along, Nabil.

Yea, it turned out that Gramm-Rudman was a sham to fool the voters
into accepting the borrow-and-spend policies of the last 12 years.

					^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Anyone can expand the economy by chargeing $3 trillion on their credit
cards.   Big deal.  Deficit spending only expands the economy in the short
term.  In the long term it shrinks the economy for numerous reasons. I would 
have MUCH preferred that the taxpayers had that $3 trillion instead.

If Reagan had kept his campaign PROMISE to balance the budget by 1983,
there would have been no need for Bush or Clinton to raise taxes.  And
all Reagan had to do was balance that puny Carter deficit.

Chew on that awhile.

------------------------------
Wrong, if a bunch of faggots from the tenderloin decide to go straight
bashing and they selectively target a heterosexual man and beat the bloody
fuck out of him, they would get charged as well under all the federal laws
that exist about violation of civils rights. The focus of their intent is
his sexual orientation, and so the law applies to them as well. The
national government retains the right to make any laws necessary to
sufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone's civil rights
until that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it!
The fact is, that at last count, gays were not beating straights for their
sexual orientation. Thus, the law is getting applied only to the straights
who indulge themselves. The federal government or judiciary has the right
to enforce the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under law even
if it takes 1000 possible charges against people who would violate them. Go
read your constitutional law. We broke the back of the KKK's harrassment
campaign with the same strategy in the early 1900's. So many went to jail
and for so long that it cut the heart out of the KKK.

This "mutation" as you call it, protects your little butt too, if you
happen to be somewhere where you're the wrong "shade" for somebody else's
taste. If it can be shown that the motive for the assault on you was
racially motivated, then the full power of these extra laws that bring more
charges and punishments will come against those who harmed you. The first
use of such laws was well over a hundred years ago, and constitutional
scholars of all conviction recognize that this right reserved to the
federal government is well established and not just some short-lived
peculiarity, too! Go read some constitutional law for awhile. Maybe you'll
get it.

---------------------------
The federal government has used such laws to allow mutliple charges in
order to prevent more crimes than would nromally occur just from two people
being pissed off at each other. The federal government has an interest in
the intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of
civil rights. It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting a
lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically.
It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid
since over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group was
getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being
part of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the south
stick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normally
they wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were
expeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to try
it anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under
the law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent
as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to
somebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they did
the school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and the
president can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the
militia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the
thousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey
or face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms! And by god,
they did! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets! And
the governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls
that had brought the order to nationalize the guard. And that's why we need
such an ability in federal jurisdiction.

                    Office of the Press Secretary
______________________________________________________________
For Immediate Release                             April 13, 1993     

	     
                      REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT,
               SECRETARY OF EDUCATION RICHARD RILEY AND
                   SECRETARY OF LABOR ROBERT REICH  IN 
                GOALS 2000 SATELLITE TOWN HALL MEETING
	     
                     Chamber of Commerce Building
                           Washington, D.C.   



8:30 P.M. EDT
	     
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you 
in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking 
part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.
	     
	     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas 
Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to 
mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he 
has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all 
followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education 
here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according 
to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational 
system.
	     
	     His philosophy of government, his belief in the 
importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest 
here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us 
President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in 
the Chamber of Commerce studios.  
	     
	     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for 
taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite 
network and we welcome you here this evening.
	     
	     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  
And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening 
also.
	     
	     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure 
many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that 
you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In 
Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.
	     
	     I believe the President has a few words that he might 
want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that 
at this time.  It's great to have you.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.
	     
	     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob 
Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the 
Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, 
along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine 
tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people 
from school to the work place.
	     
	     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, 
recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this 
economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to 
work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to 
make things happen.
	     
	     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that 
kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home 
state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart 
Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing 
several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I 
appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all 
the rest of you.
	     
	     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward 
constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about 
this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson 
believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in 
education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, 
freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and 
third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  
	     
	     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this 
beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful 
cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change 
with changing times.
	     
	     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit 
and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we 
can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --
about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless 
we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in 
government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase 
our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the 
long run.
	     
	     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  
And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven 
or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system 
and continues into the work force where education must go on for a 
lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can 
learn.
	     
	     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing 
we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership 
between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the 
private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're 
trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that 
would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many 
thousands that have a strong education component so our young people 
can be learning and working at the same time.
	     
	     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good 
place we can begin, I think, the discussion.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.
	     
	     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all 
citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And 
tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours 
can prepare students for this world of work.
	     
	     This week, the Education Department and the Labor 
Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called 
Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  
The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's 
proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched 
jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged 
areas of the country.  
	     
	     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it 
somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls 
for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your 
words is that so important?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  
First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may 
have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want 
them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to 
continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of 
research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may 
forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year 
over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for 
schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already 
taught before.
	     
	     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, 
not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to 
abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is 
learning because we think that the best and most productive workers 
will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience 
could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to 
succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are 
disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go 
into the next year, is really even greater.  
	     
	     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs 
throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this 
educational component of training.
	     
	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. 
Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer 
or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with 
education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, 
for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning 
geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or 
working on something, and they can see the exact and direct 
application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a 
lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between 
education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  
It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of 
young people even beyond the summer.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  
	     
	     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship 
program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell 
us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it 
developing.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why 
it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade 
will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will 
require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people 
get in a high school diploma.  
	     
	     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries 
of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school 
education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young 
people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not 
go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because 
they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their 
employers.
	     
	     So we think America has a big economic interest in 
trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school 
but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes 
two years of further training either in a community college, a 
vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in 
this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some 
funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states 
and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in 
a way that would be customized essentially by the business community, 
based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could 
revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and 
the earnings of American workers.
	     
	     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think 
you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the 
people watching this program -- that the business community and 
educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many 
of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In 
fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The 
people watching this program probably are the ones who are most 
directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley 
and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes 
already out there.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight 
about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  
career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal 
with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of 
these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?
	     
	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and 
you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much 
longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business 
community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're 
doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The 
Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these 
kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've 
aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.
	     
	     The business community is going to be actively engaged 
in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and 
helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions 
develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.
	     
	     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is 
one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these 
players in a community come together and work together and cooperate 
together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and 
the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody 
is talking, but they're not really working together in a common 
strategy.
	     
	     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, 
would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic 
excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a 
tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to 
make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be 
eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year 
college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're 
talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation 
skills for on-the-job learning.
	     
	     And again, those are the critical components.  It's 
already being done.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one 
point based on my personal experience at home -- the business 
community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are 
the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, 
but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort 
of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are 
going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the 
second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and 
influence them.  So I think that's very important.
	     
	     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at 
the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some 
funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make 
sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the 
quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to 
determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of 
course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery 
program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about 
long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. 
President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the 
communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be 
coming forth before too long.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I 
were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public 
schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that 
a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  
	     
	     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals 
that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President 
Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to 
do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in 
Congress that will actually define the things that the national 
government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the 
children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those 
goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school 
ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school 
graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are 
confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are 
second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, 
disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took 
them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of 
life-long learning in this country.
	     
	     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a 
state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector 
role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to 
introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; 
and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job 
is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality 
that we need to meet.
	     
	     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite 
like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  
Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their 
money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and 
partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really 
it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms 
of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to 
support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform 
efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.
	     
	     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to 
the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of 
course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and 
I wonder if you would comment on that.
	     
	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of 
our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they 
don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system 
of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had 
national skill standards to which they could aspire and which 
employers would understand as a national credential, many of these 
young people would actually find that they were much more eligible 
for jobs.
	     
	     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other 
countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to 
college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain 
technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If 
you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to 
develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working 
with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private 
industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the 
kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other 
institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go 
ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce 
Todd of Austin, Texas.
	     
	     Q	  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and 
Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We 
have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who 
have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me 
simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with 
much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are 
very supportive.  
	     
	     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our 
summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to 
have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much 
as 3,500 with the federal assistance.  
	     
	     Much of the question that we had designed you have 
answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But 
the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day 
would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round 
is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal 
level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-
round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the 
local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's 
something that we believe is very important to success in this 
effort.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to 
answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, 
and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  
I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  
	     
	     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can 
structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer 
program and that will move a lot of these young people back into 
schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in 
the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to 
try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs 
to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're 
working on that.
	     
	     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the 
Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to 
build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job 
training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give 
heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you 
asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we 
hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being 
trained on a year-round basis.
	     
	     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said 
a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen 
as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people 
actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when 
they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we 
hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and 
we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget 
cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue 
raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be 
able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.
	     
	     Bob, do you want to say anything?
	     
	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out 
of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, 
and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high 
school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in 
addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of 
jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  
It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the 
economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything 
else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I 
think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I 
think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or 
greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going 
to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything 
right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 
will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into 
next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it 
will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working 
together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And 
then the state, with all the various school districts, a very 
important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I 
think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that 
moving.
	     
	     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  
	     
	     Doctor?
	     
	     Q	  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to 
be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school 
and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since 
its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two 
alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages 
we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an 
extremely effective learning strategy.
	     
	     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are 
several principles that are very important in bridging the school and 
work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with 
practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure 
to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect 
upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and 
lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the 
development of high performance competencies.  
	     
	     My question, then is:  How can the general education 
faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with 
transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies 
can you suggest to achieve this integration?
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- 
and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting 
work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next 
guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   
in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to 
them and we can discuss it later.
	     
	     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one 
thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as 
clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the 
people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more 
explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics 
is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish 
what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is 
vocational learning and what is academic learning.
	     
	     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think 
we should have a strong component for people who are in the 
vocational program.
	     
	     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to 
rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and 
work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're 
important for all students.  It's not just a special group of 
students that needs them.
	     
	     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United 
States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream 
experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and 
12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience 
and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on 
to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they 
can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and 
career directions.
	     
	     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often 
goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-
related work within the classroom, within our schools.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's 
going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I 
think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank 
you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and 
your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  

                                 END9:00 P.M. EDT

The most recent reason given by the Clinton Administration for
calling for federally funded abortions is that many private
health insurance programs offer coverage for abortion.

RE: Abortion and my health insurance coverage


TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

I recently have become aware that my health insurance includes
coverage for abortion.  I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of
conscience.  It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums may
be being used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is
murder.  I would like to request that I be exempted from abortion
coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly.

                              Sincerely,



My policy number is:

To your state and national representatives:





RE: Abortion and health coverage

Dear 


It has recently come to my attention as a result of the current
abortion debate that my health insurance coverage provided by my
employer may include coverage paying for abortions.  

I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of conscience and am
disturbed greatly that my coverage may be being used in this
manner.  However, I depend on my employers' provided health
coverage, and fear that if I speak up about it, that I may lose
not only my coverage but even my job.

I would like to ask you to put into law the provision that health
insurance providers make abortion coverage non-compulsory in
their health insurance program, so that it can be declined, with
an appropriate reduction in premium.

In order that there be no difference in the dollar ammount in the
health benefit packages between those who would choose to have
abortion coverage and those who would not, I further ask that you
include a provision in which the reduction in premium resulting
from the declining of "abortion coverage" be paid-out to the
employee, rather than pocketed by the employer.  

This second provision should serve to dissuade employers from
pressuring employees into taking one or the other stand with
regard to abortion services.  Thank you very much.  Your fellow
citizen.

                                   Sincerely,

Okay, now here's my interpretation of _Boomer_, based on the facts as
presented in the New York Court of Appeals<*> holding (_Boomer v.

<*>Note: The New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York
   State.  While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their
   highest court "Supreme Court," "Supreme Judicial Court" or "Supreme
   Court of Appeals," Maryland and New York call theirs simply the
   "Court of Appeals."  To make matters worse, New York also calls its
   _second-highest_ court the "Supreme Court, Appellate Division"...

Atlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):

Oscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's
plant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to
which came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he
defendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course
of its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the
plaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the
plant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked
the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.

(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned
their property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.
Atlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)

Instead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court
ordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided
that Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In
other words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the
power and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment
of their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is
always problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a
private firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.

(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But if
it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks
like eminent domain...)

Let me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that
"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the
plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million
dollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages."  Blackmail?

    (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....
    "Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to
    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose
    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under
    extortion statutes.")

How do you define as "blackmail" one party's act of demanding the right
to set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns
and which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of
demanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see
it, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of
owning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to
stay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price
they wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says
that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.

You go on to say: "The plant would never have been shut down -- the
plaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,
because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to
having the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less
than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation."

If so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the
business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from
other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those
other parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice
between paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,
shouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_
business?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_
the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was
Atlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type
of plant they did where and when they did.)

And then you say: "Everyone's property rights were protected; the
plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided."
As above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were "made whole."
They were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners
of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price
acceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made
whole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the
business of ensuring that "unnecessary" settlement costs are avoided?
(If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were
supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)

(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as "infamous," at least not at my
school.

(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for
their first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first
encountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal
opinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get
into their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick
and choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional
Responsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly
and self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously
intimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly
biased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors
tend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is
especially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are
practicing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_
educational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat
cloistered scholar.  End of aside.)

I called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasons
I've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can
only call "economic correctness" over justice.

(2) It is "completely sensible" only if you believe that the alleged
right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid
losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and
the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to
not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who
own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.
(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other
branch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take
other people's property by eminent domain.)

I've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to
as "law and economics" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical
analysis as one of many "tie-breaker" factors which courts may use to
help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by
the scale of "justice", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by
_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics
of a case as being more important than the justice of a case.

Jobs?  What the hell have jobs to do with it?  It's another touchy-feely 
program from the new, vapid administration.  The fact is, the major claim
made for "universal" immunization -- that "all children will be immunized" --
has absolutely no validity.  Several states already have U.I. programs, have
had these programs for _years_. The result: on average, their success rates
are no better than the national average.  It seems that the gummint hasn't
yet figured out a way to MAKE parents bring their kids in.  Yet another case
of shameless demagoguery from the "new" Democrats, the "agents of change."

	In the hopes of adding a little life to, what seems to be, the
same old debates, I would like to add a few bits of info and ask for
comments.

1) A couple days ago the headlines were splashed with stories of proof
   that the North Vietnamese had held U.S. hostages after the war ended.
	Way back in today's newspaper (Page A7 of San Francisco Chronicle)
   there is an article about the document that held the proof.
	[used without permission]

	"The document, which was discovered in the archives of the Soviet
    Communist Party in Moscow, is a Russian translation of what is described
    as a September 1972 report prepared for the Vietnam Politburo by General
    Tran Van Quang, who is identified as the deputy chief of staff of the
    North Vietnamese army."
         [later on in the article after it talks about the claim of 1,205
           Americans in North Vietnamese prisons]
	"Phong said the easiest way to prove that the document is a 
    fabrication is to review Quang's career. In 1972, he said, Quang was 
    not deputy chief of staff; he was the army commander in Military Region 4
    in central Vietnam."

2) I heard on the radio that the Church of Scientology has filed for 
   bankrupcy becuase the employees of Cocolat , owned by CoS, filed a 
   class action suit against them for requiring the employees to pay dues
   to become members of the Church. Anyone heard more about this?

3) Micheal Jackson went into business with Micheal Milken. No lie.

Some say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result of

Oh?  When did She *stop*?  Mother Nature has been automatically providing
us with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze.  It
is not "produced": it produces itself, year after year.  Last night, for
example, I saw four deer crossing the road (pretty sight, too); in an

The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often
freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and
clothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their
Polynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared
many things with the other Islanders.  In fact, "hi'ipoi", the Hawaiian
word for "cherish" means "sharing food".  The Great Mahele, in which
the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and
the poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will often
share tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village
and neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to
Africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so-
called "theft" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which,
until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.

These are the people we call "savages".

On the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.

Dov, before you make further comment on this thread, I think it would
behoove you to study *all* of the facts.

You asked a question, and now you don't want people to answer?  I believe
a legitimate question was asked.  Why shouldn't cost and safety be used
(at least in part) to determine legality?

I'd like to see you *prove* that drug legalization is an idiotic idea.
Seems to me the evidence from Great Britain is pretty convincing that 
drug legalization is a good idea.  Even such a noted conservative as
William F. Buckley supports it.

Your examples (except for prostitution) fail miserably to meet both criteria
(safer AND cheaper).  Obviously, killing people is not "safe".  As for
prostitution, why shouldn't it be legal?

The Bill of Rights, as far as I can see, does not once refer to "citizens",
but it makes several references to "people". For example, Article IV:
"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,
and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be
violated"; Article V: "no person shall be held to answer for a capital,
or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment by
a Grand Jury ...  nor shall any person ... be deprived of life, liberty,
or property, without due process of law"; Article VIII: "excessive bail
shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual
punishments inflicted".

Now I've never heard that Constitutional rights apply only to citizens;
aren't they meant to apply equally to all *persons* living in the U.S.?
Whether slaves were considered "not human" I don't know, but it seems
that a case could be made that they weren't treated as "people" as defined
in the Bill of Rights. And since the nation is nominally based on the
Declaration of Independence which states that "all Men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness",
it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definition
of humanity.

Absolutely.  If Yoni and Bibi Natanyahu are "typical jew leader"s,
then I personally am proud to aspire to such a status (disregarding
Hamaza H. Salah's negative connotation of Jews).  Yoni was a great
man and a Harvard grad who died for his country and people.  Bibi
is also a great leader who will undoubtedly be a major force in

Although I'm an atheist, the events in Waco have really sickened me.  It's
truely a sad day for religious freedom in this country.  The Branch
Dividians may have been nutty (my general opinion of all religious people),
but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not grounds
for destroying a people.

The killing of the four BATF agents was surey a dispicable act, but that was
an escalation of the confrontation which the BATF started.  War is bad
precisely because of humanity's tendancy for escalation.  That principle
applies to all cases of warfare- whether it's between nuclear superpowers,
feuding families or fledgling religious groups and our federal govt.  Why
was warfare chosen as the course of action when patience and subtlety would
also have worked?  Why is the petty letter of the law more important than
peoples' lives and religious beliefs?  Perhaps the supposed professionals in
our federal law inforcement agencies are just plain stupid.

It was interesting to watch the 700 club today.  Pat Robertson said that the
"Branch Dividians had met the firey end for worshipping their false god." He
also said that this was a terrible tragedy and that the FBI really blew it. 
However, I still feel that he's forgetting that every major religion in the
world had a similarly humble 'cult-status' beginning- even, and perhaps
especially, christianity.  It is perhaps worthwhile to consider that the
Branch Dividians' apocalyptic prophecies have been fulfilled.  Maybe David
Koresh really was Jesus Christ (sure sounds like a neat opening epic for a
new major religion to me).

Here is a press release from the Reserve Officers Association.

 Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations to
Close Naval, Marine Reserve Centers
 To: National Desk, Defense Writer
 Contact: Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of
          the United States, 202-479-2258

   WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve Officers
Association of the United States has alerted the Defense Base
Realignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to give
sufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close
56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.
   In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of
Congress with affected locations in their constituencies, including
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list
ignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior
service personnel.
   ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.),
suggested "concern that the only plausible alternative is that they
are intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve
components from maintaining even today's relatively low level of
participation in their parent service's Total Force of the future."
   He asked the commission "to remove from consideration all
locations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to
warrant approval of the requested action."
   "Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve
installations on this list are large enough to have a significant
impact on the community, if closed," wrote Hultman.  "The major
issue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large
percentage of the existing locations."
   Hultman reminded the commission, "The fact that the vast
majority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come
close to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this
process certainly supports the thesis" that these actions are
simply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and
Marine Corps Reserve.
   ROA also noted "that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of
Naval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480
Naval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are
approved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities."
   Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging
from South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval
Reserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to
Missoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval/Marine Corps Reserve
Centers include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind.,
Billings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas.
   A major Marine Reserve Center on the list is that at El
Toro, Calif., plus six others.

       I wonder if he realizes the irony of a Federal Secretary

Cal State University system offers bachlors and masters degrees.  The

Nearly all the professors have PhDs.  I haven't had a professor who didn't,
though my wife has had a couple of professors with just an M.A.  A friend
had an instructor who didn't have a degree at all, but because he had
been Minister of Culture for the Black Panthers, he was teaching anyway.
He had a bad habit of usually not showing up to teach the class, and
finally quit in disgust at the racism of a university that expected him
to show up to teach.

# Tim Fogarty (FOGARTY@SIR-C.JPL.NASA.GOV)

At Sonoma State University, typical class size is 20 to 30 per class.
Teaching is definitely more the goal, and sometimes, it actually happens.
The best professors at Sonoma State U. are equivalent to the best 
professors I had at UCLA and USC.

For Immediate Release                             April 14, 1993     

	     
                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
                      AT SUMMER JOBS CONFERENCE

	     	  
                            Hyatt Regency
                        Crystal City, Virginia  


11:22 A.M. EDT

	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that 
Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today 
about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to 
get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature 
of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of 
people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of 
those who are here.  
	     
	     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education 
and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my 
good friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and 
all of the business and local community leaders from the city and 
county and state level from around America who are here. 
	     
	     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved 
hearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is 
their future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A 
year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because 
I was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our 
country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had 
too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines 
of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to 
take us into the future.  
	     
	     I entered with the hope that together we could create 
more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of 
our people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of 
America's community, knowing that together we could always to more 
than we could individually and that we might secure our future.
	     
	     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 
jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the 
commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, 
and those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs 
does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this 
stage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all 
those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're 
on the right track.
	     
	     Last July when I was traveling across America's 
heartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in 
Louisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business 
people who were participating in the Louisville Education and 
Employment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  
I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed 
both in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my 
own state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about 
-- that for millions of American young people it is really an 
impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good 
workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what 
is learning.
	     
	     In the world in which we are living, the average young 
person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a 
lifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning 
world much better.  And we must determine that all of our young 
people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased 
here today.  
	     
	     Whether you're in business or in government or in 
education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to 
building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all 
of our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things 
are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best 
thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have 
jobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  
	     
	     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty 
good education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that 
they'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either 
political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great 
challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to 
fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work 
for them to do.
	     
	     All the European countries have higher unemployment 
rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the 
unemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  
They're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its 
most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that 
I have proposed to create jobs. 
	     
	     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now 
about as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  
It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of 
pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing 
their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their 
people.  
	     
	     But it is especially important for America for two 
reasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move 
aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be 
competitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, 
even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed 
of the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to 
work in this country.  (Applause.)
	     
	     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some 
of it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and 
moving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We 
have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big 
organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they 
are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working 
at some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to 
create jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the 
chance to work.  
	     
	     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare 
reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of 
months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the 
end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  
(Applause.)
	     
	     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of 
the American people to perform without regard to race or income or 
the circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that 
there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their 
talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  
I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if 
you want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more 
responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this 
country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you 
have got to have opportunity in that mix. 
	     
	     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for 
every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules 
and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be 
something at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are 
basically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, 
recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of 
our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their 
background.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's 
something there for them to do?

	     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an 
integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of 
work and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people 
first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private 
sector.
	     
	     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in 
February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 
extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the 
American business community to meet that target so that we can create  
more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been 
created before.
	     
	     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And 
Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in 
this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more 
than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people 
a work experience.  And it is terribly important.
	     
	     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is 
part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the 
American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their 
jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving 
the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to 
college but do need at least two years of post-high school training 
either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, 
so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more 
people to go on to college who do want to go.
	     
	     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive 
plan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The 
emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would 
create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and 
that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It 
would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work 
force in jobs that otherwise will not be created.
	     
	      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to 
invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --
projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, 
new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities 
-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve 
the environment.  
	     
	     The summer jobs program is an important part of that 
because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the 
Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching 
out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer 
jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to 
hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young 
people into further educational opportunities and to further job 
opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component 
to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government 
has never fully emphasized before.  
	     
	     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because 
they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in 
difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building 
their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other 
areas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who 
have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what 
they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next 
year.  
	     
	     What we are trying to do here is to give people the 
opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning 
skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next 
couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school 
in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning 
environment.  
	     
	     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities 
for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this 
will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will 
be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new 
work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.
	     
	     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-
work jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding 
the job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help 
to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve 
local problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public 
buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in 
hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, 
and learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while 
they earn, but letting them earn.
	     
	     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people 
who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should 
do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the 
opportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing 
in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't 
exactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare 
system; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people 
to work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the 
use of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if 
you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to 
reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  
(Applause.)
	     
	     The young people we propose to put to work under our 
program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, 
reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will 
stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a 
sense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, 
but a challenge that will take them into a different life.
	     
	     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even 
as I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the 
summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll 
see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer 
academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved 
ahead.  I suspect that they will.  
	     
	     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I 
will be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn 
from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next 
summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school 
year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that 
we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so 
that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private 
investments as well. 
	     
	     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the 
business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this 
summer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business 
who have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who 
haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about 
this event today, I want to implore other private employers to 
stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this 
summer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when 
we don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort 
them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)
	     
	     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up 
here on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking 
about work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've 
done to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very 
foolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand 
and sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had 
ever had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be 
worth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     That does not mean young people should not be 
entrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation 
ahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and 
worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  
And I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some 
people say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  
	     
	     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I 
grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul 
without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a 
job.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to 
people is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a 
job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now 
I live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any 
more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're 
working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  
And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these 
young people want.
	     
	     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  
It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration 
pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private 
sector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn 
how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created 
in this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done 
off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a 
third or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do 
economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of 
America's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just 
kidding.  
	     
	     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy 
country in the world, including the United States, is having 
difficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done 
I'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole 
deliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the 
answers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  
(Applause.)
	     
	     And so the jobs program that I have presented to 
Congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the 
counties, through the Community Development Program, with the 
infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an 
attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the 
economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little 
boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a 
million jobs and maybe get the engine going again.
	     
	     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in 
the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government 
money.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American 
economy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind 
of system we have and it works pretty well.  
	     
	     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you 
here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends 
and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers 
to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the 
funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government 
should create this summer, so that together we can have this 
partnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a 
future -- a future that our young people can believe in.  
	     
	     We need to send them a message that here in America if 
you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute 
something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  
You can build a future from you own dreams. 
	     
	     That has always been the promise of America.  Together 
that's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of 
the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise 
has been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.
	     
	     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

                            PRESS BRIEFING
                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS


                          The Briefing Room


12:40 P.M. EDT
	     
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm just prepared to take 
questions today.
	     
	     Q	  George, Bob Dole says that the Clinton 
administration's policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the 
United States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that 
the Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, President Clinton has 
said that that suggestion is under active consideration.  Obviously, 
this is a tragic situation in Bosnia.  And if the Bosnian Serbs don't 
come to the negotiating table in a constructive way, we'll look 
seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo.  In the meantime, 
we're going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in 
the U.N.  We're going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the 
negotiating table.  But the prospect of an arms embargo is something 
the President certainly will consider if the Serbs don't come to the 
table.
	     
	     Q	  How much longer are you going to give them to come 
to the table, George?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on that right now.
	     
	     Q	  It's been a long time.
	     
	     Q	  On February 19th, the President mentioned the value 
added tax in Ohio.  And when he was asked about it later by 
reporters, he said -- quote -- "That is a radical change in the tax 
system of the United States.  It's something I think we may have to 
look at in the years ahead."  Questioned again about it later he 
says, "It is not something that is now under consideration.  If we 
start considering it, I'll tell you."  It wasn't a trial balloon or 
anything, he said.  I was just discussing the tax response to a 
question.  Donna Shalala, quoted in USA Today this morning -- quote -
- "Certainly we're looking at a VAT."  What's gone on?
	     
	     Q	  The same with Alice Rivlin this morning.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The health care task force is 
reviewing a number of options.  They haven't made any decisions yet.  
And as I have said from this podium time and time again, we're not 
going to comment on decisions that haven't been made.
	     
	     Q	  But you have also said from this podium time and 
time again --
	     
	     Q	  Wait a minute.  Whoa, Nelly.  Whoa.  
	     
	     Q	     that that was not under consideration.
	     
	     Q	  Yes.  Clinton says, "It is not something that is 
now under consideration."  Is that no longer true?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe the working group, as Ms. 
Shalala says, has looked at this prospect, but no decisions have been 
made of any kind.
	     
	     Q	  Well, I know.  But he said he'd tell us about it if 
it was ever under consideration.  I take it that now he is and he 
didn't tell us about it or --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Did he say if it was under 
consideration or if it was something to be proposed?
	     
	     Q	  "If we start considering I'll tell you."
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If it's something to be proposed?
	     
	     Q	  "If we start considering it, I'll tell you."  
That's a direct quote.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The task force has looked at a 
number of different options.  They have not made any decisions yet.  
The President has not made any decisions yet.  This is -- one of the 
proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and 
cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform 
the health care system.  They have cast a very wide net.  They have 
looked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of 
different proposals.  But the President has not made any decisions.
	     
	     Q	  Well, is the President aware of their consideration 
of this option?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he's been briefed 
on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task 
force on this specific proposal of any kind.  I don't know that 
that's gotten to his level.  He started yesterday to go through with 
the task force a very wide range of decisions and I don't believe 
that that's been presented to him, no.
	     
	     Q	  Well, he's not relying on the USA Today to tell him 
what his task force is considering in the way of taxes.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he's going through it in a very 
deliberate fashion.  There are a number of decisions that have to be 
made.  I don't know that this proposal has reached that decision-
making point.
	     
	     Q	  If this is still under consideration, that's a 
change, at least from what we've been told by Dee Dee, I think about 
three weeks ago or so.  She said, that is not an option, talking 
about the -- had a big argument with somebody over this, so I 
remember it specifically -- and said it not once, but twice.  Is that 
not the case?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if this has 
been presented to the President as something that is being looked at 
at some level in the task force.
	     
	     Q	  It was ruled it out, though.  I mean, unlike other 
options that you've kept in the mix, this one specifically was ruled 
out.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, this is something that is 
being looked at, but no decision has been made of any kind.  I mean, 
it doesn't -- it's not necessarily material until you get to the 
decision-making phase.  The working groups are looking at hundreds of 
different options.
	     
	     Q	  If it was ruled out before and it's not ruled out 
now, then something has changed, George.  Yes, no?
	     
	     Q	  When a guy says in February --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the working groups are 
looking at the widest possible range of options.
	     
	     Q	  So something's changed.  They weren't looking at it 
before; they're looking at it now.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know if the working 
groups have gotten to that point yet.  They are casting a very wide 
net.
	     
	     Q	  How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able 
to sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now 
are saying that, in fact, it is being considered?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups are 
looking at a wide range of options.  They have not --
	     
	     Q	  Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it -- flatly 
ruled it out on several occasions in the past month?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't deny that -- I mean, those 
are the President's words.  Those are very clear.
	     
	     Q	  Subsequent to the President's words, do you deny 
that within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled 
it out?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about the timing.  I 
think what we did was refer back to the President's words and say 
they stand.
	     
	     Q	  So don't they stand any longer?
	     
	     Q	  March 25th, Clinton said for the next four to five 
years it was ruled out.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, those words -- the President 
did say that in February.  The working groups are on a separate 
track, and as I said, I don't believe --
	     
	     Q	  Separate from the President?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe this has been 
presented to the President.
	     
	     Q	  Are they considering something that the President 
--
	     
	     Q	  Has ruled out?
	     
	     Q	     has ruled out?  I mean, will the President 
consider a VAT tax?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups have not 
presented this to the President.  They have looked at a wide range of 
options.  I suppose that if an argument is made, he will clearly 
listen to it.  That does not mean he has decided to do it.
	     
	     Q	  Can we put this another way?  In his answer in 
Ohio, he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax 
system.  Under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it 
might be considered at some future point.  Is that no longer the 
case, or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm not sure exactly what 
you're asking.
	     
	     Q	  He talked about the VAT in the context of a 
restructured tax system, not as a specific way to finance health 
care, for example.
	     
	     Q	  Or anything else.
	     
	     Q	  Or anything else.
	     
	     Q	  It was always in the context of substituting for 
other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.
	     
	     Q	  Has that change, too?
	     
	     Q	  Is that still his view?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I haven't spoken about those 
specific comments.  I think -- I can just go back to it -- are the 
working groups -- have they examined the possibility of a VAT?  Yes, 
they have.
	     
	     Q	  Certainly we're looking at a VAT, she said.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They have examined the possibility 
of a VAT.  Has it been presented to the President?  Has he made a 
decision?  No, he has not.
	     
	     Q	  What kind of a deal do you have when you've got the 
President's appointed task force, obviously not oblivious to his 
ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line 
reform, goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has 
specifically ruled out in any context other than much later, and then 
goes ahead and announces that that's what they're looking at?  Is the 
President concerned about that sort of thing?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that the President's 
concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal 
possible.  He's concerned with making sure that they have the most 
thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives, all the 
different alternatives.  If a decision is made to go forward with 
something like that it's certainly something the President will 
explain and justify.  But no decision has been made along those 
lines.
	     
	     Q	  What does it mean exactly, though, when the 
President rules something out?  Does it mean it can get back on the 
table later if a more persuasive argument is made?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just -- that's indisputably 
true.  If you -- but, at the same time, he has not ruled it in.  He 
has not made a proposal.
	     
	     Q	  What makes him open to it now when he wasn't open 
to it before?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's certainly willing to listen to 
the argument.
	     
	     Q	  Was he willing to listen to the argument for a 
short-term tax this year, and he wasn't willing to listen to it in 
Chilicothe?  He's now open to it --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The context of his comments was 
that it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not 
something he was proposing, not something he was floating.
	     
	     Q	  Not something he was considering.  Those are his 
words -- "It's not something that's now under consideration.  If we 
start considering it, I'll tell you."  You're now acknowledging, are 
you not, that it is under consideration and --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm acknowledging that the task 
force has studied this proposal.  I am also stating that the 
President has not made a decision on it.
	     
	     Q	  But the door is open for the President to 
reconsider including this as part of --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously, the working groups are 
looking at it.  Again, but the President has not made a decision.
	     
	     Q	  Do you know if they will make a presentation on 
behalf of the VAT to him?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that.  I assume that 
if -- I don't know what stage they are it in proposing.  I don't know 
that they're going to make the conclusion that this is something they 
should present to him.  I know this is something the working groups 
are looking at.
	     
	     Q	  Do you understand, George, that none of us are 
asking these questions in context of a decision that the President 
has made, only about what the President is considering?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I understand that, and I am 
acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a 
VAT.
	     
	     Q	  And the President will consider it?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I assume that he will consider the 
argument if it is presented to him.
	     
	     Q	  Does that mean the President -- that working groups 
think that when the President says no, he means maybe?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that means that the working 
groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible.
	     
	     Q	  George, can I ask you another question about 
Bosnia?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  No, he wants us to stay on this.
	     
	     Q	  Let's do gays in the military.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  No, he got out of that swamp.
	     
	     Q	  I think we've gotten the bottom line on that VAT.  
Reggie Bartholomew, your Special Ambassador in Belgrade, today said 
that if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked 
out -- quote -- "We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the 
arms embargo together with our allies."  That seems to go a bit 
further than what you've just said --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sounds almost exactly what I just 
said.
	     
	     Q	  Well, do you accept -- in other words, you accept 
what Reggie --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President has said that 
this is something that's under consideration.  It is something he 
will consider if the current actions don't bring the Serbs to the 
table.
	     
	     Q	  Isn't there some kind of timetable here?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, there is a timetable.  There's 
going to be a vote on the U.N. resolution in about 10 days.
	     
	     Q	  That's on sanctions, that's on tightening the 
sanctions.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's right, that's sanctions.  
And we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure, and we hope 
that that will bring the Serbs to the table.  As you know, Mr. 
Bartholomew also met with Mr. Churkin of Russia, and they are also 
working on ways to bring the Serbs to the table.  We will continue to 
pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option 
as well.
	     
	     Q	  The question is whether there's a timetable for 
consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo, 
not the sanctions.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The next vote in the U.N. is on 
sanctions.  As far as I know, there are no votes scheduled on lifting 
the arms embargo.  But it is something that we have discussed both 
internally and with our allies.
	     
	     Q	  Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the 
U.S. would do that?  What was the point of his telling them that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, clearly, I mean, this is 
something that's under consideration, and this is something that we 
take quite seriously if they do not come to the table.  They should 
know the consequences of failing to come to the table.
	     
	     Q	  Have they been given a deadline?
	     
	     Q	  Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing 
and it hasn't seemed to change the Serbs' behavior in the least.  Why 
should the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo 
when so far everything that's been done has had no effect on the 
fighting in Bosnia?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't accept the premise of 
your question.  It has had an effect; the embargo is having an 
effect.  
	     
	     Q	  What effect?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If the Serbians choose not to heed 
our warnings, then they will face the consequences.
	     
	     Q	  What effect has it had in Bosnia?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the effect that it has had on 
the Serbians, it has tightened up -- they are not getting their 
shipments through.  We can brief more fully --
	     
	     Q	  In Bosnia, George.  In Bosnia what effect has it 
had?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it's hard to say if it's 
stopped the aggression to date.  That is why we're continuing to 
press for the Serbians to stop.  But we believe that over time we 
will continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have   an effect.  
I'm not saying it's going to happen overnight; it clearly hasn't 
happened overnight.  But we believe that over time the sanctions can 
weaken the Serbs.  If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come 
to the negotiating table, we'll move forward with the embargo.
	     
	     Q	  Isn't there a working deadline, George, of the 24th 
-- the same date as the U.N. -- the scheduled U.N. vote?  Hasn't the 
United States said, along with many of the other NATO allies, that if 
the Serbs aren't willing to sign on to the peace accord by then, that 
we'll seek -- haven't we said that we will seek --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We've said continually we're going 
to --
	     
	     Q	  But on that deadline?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have a specific date, but 
we're going to move forward with the resolution, the U.N. resolution, 
by around that time.  And if that fails to take effect, if that fails 
to bring the Serbs to the table, we will clearly consider other 
actions.
	     
	     Q	  Isn't this awfully incremental?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're taking a step-by-step 
approach.  We're ratcheting up the pressure and we're going to 
continue to do that.
	     
	     Q	  Is there a possibility, George, that by the time 
all these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved 
their goals and then what's the purpose?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the purpose is to get the 
Serbs to stop the aggression.  We are pursuing that goal on many 
different fronts.  We are pursuing it through the U.N.; we're 
pursuing it through direct talks; we are pursuing it through 
tightening the sanctions.  And we will consider lifting the arms 
embargo.  We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will 
continue to do that.
	     
	     Q	  But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in 
getting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any 
campaign be to have the Serbs give back what they've gained?  I mean, 
once they're entrenched --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't speculate on that.  We're 
going to continue to press for them to come to the table now.  We're 
going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression.  But I can't 
see into the future.
	     
	     Q	  George, on the stimulus package, House Republicans 
say they're going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to 
try and explain the details of your package.  They cite polls which 
show that the more people learn about it, the less they like it.  
What's your strategy to counter that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The strategy we have is the one 
we're going to continue.  As you saw, the President today pointed up 
the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package 
will provide:  700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner 
cities and suburbs to do productive work.  We are also going to point 
out the benefits of the highway money, the investments in highways.  
We're going to point up the benefits of immunization.  We're going to 
point up the benefits of Head Start.  We are going to say that the 
Republicans have a choice:  they can take action to create jobs or 
they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years. 
	     
	     Q	  Does it concern you, though, that the House now, 
the House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The House Republicans voted against 
it before.  They made a mistake then; they're making a mistake now.
	     
	     Q	  George, does it strike anybody in the 
administration that it's a bit strong to describe, as the President 
did this morning, the summer jobs program as -- quote -- "a 
reaffirmation of a promise of America"?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I think it's the 
promise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full 
potential. 
	     
	     Q	  Government-funded jobs?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  To give people a chance to work?  
Absolutely.  That is the promise of America.
	     
	     Q	  I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday 
-- where does 700,000 summer jobs, where does that figure come from?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is on top of.  I did look at 
it.  There are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline.  This 
will be on top of the 600,000, so it will be a total of 1.3 million.
	     
	     Q	  The 700,000 would be created by the stimulus 
package?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Where does that number come from?  Because we've 
been told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000 
new jobs.  And according to Panetta, that breaks down to something 
like 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, but the summer -- that's when 
you do their full-time equivalence.  I mean, 700,000 individuals will 
receive jobs this summer.  When you calculate it for the full-time 
job effect, you have to do -- I don't know what the exact formula is.
	     
	     Q	  Seven hundred thousand part-time jobs --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- 150,000 or --
	     
	     Q	  One to four because it's three months.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Thank you.
	     
	     Q	  Can I follow up on that?  Did the President 
misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money 
for these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the 
private sector?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not necessarily.  I mean, I think 
that there will be grants available.  That's one of the ways that you 
pay for the jobs.  At the same time, he's also issued a challenge to 
the private sector to hire kids on their own as well.  
	     
	     Q	  Tax dollars, for instance, would pay for kids to 
work at Time-Warner?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the Time-Warner is actually 
somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant.  That's going to 
be the bulk of it.  There could be isolated instances, though, where 
there would be grants to businesses.
	     
	     Q	  Has the President spoken with any Senate 
Republicans this week?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  
No, but there's been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the 
White House.
	     
	     Q	  At a lower level.  But the President hasn't?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has not, no.
	     
	     Q	  Getting any closer to get the votes?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're continuing to work on it. 
	     
	     Q	  Anybody leaning your way?
	     
	     Q	  On Haiti, The New York Times seems to be reporting 
something of a breakthrough in Aristide's attitude towards the coup 
leaders.  Can you confirm that there has been this change, and what 
impact will it have on the process?  And what did Pezzullo have to 
say yesterday in his report?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Pezzullo did brief the principals.  
I can't confirm what's actually happening in the talks.  I would 
leave that to the negotiators themselves.  But Mr. Caputo has 
returned to Haiti.  We have received a briefing here at the White 
House from Ambassador Pezzullo.  And as we have said time and time 
again, we believe that assurances of security are important to a 
final resolution to a broader political settlement.
	     
	     Q	  George, yesterday you offered some selective 
breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities.  
Can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be 
impacted?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we have it for most states, 
yes.  And I think we can get it out.
	     
	     Q	  Could you make that generally available?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe we can.
	     
	     Q	  And could you do it by the component of the 
stimulus?  In other words --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if we can do -- I know 
that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs.  I don't know how 
deeply it can be broken down.  But clearly, we can break it down into 
summer jobs and other jobs.
	     
	     Q	  And can I follow up?  Is this the information that 
Jeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the 
states?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they're ads, but 
they're press releases.
	     
	     Q	  Can you describe what those press releases contain?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All we're doing is pointing out the 
benefits of this package to various states.  For instance, I know 
that today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire.  
And I would point out that the stimulus package, the jobs package 
creates 1,000 jobs in Vermont.  It creates 2,000 jobs in New 
Hampshire.  And the people of those states should remind him that 
this is important. 
	     
	     Q	  Where are the releases going?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They go to the states.
	     
	     Q	  To whom?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We can get them.  It's no problem.
	     
	     Q	  Can we get it?
	     
	     Q	  Why don't you put them out here as well?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we can.
	     
	     Q	  This afternoon?  Would that be possible?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to check.  I don't know.  
But as soon as we can.
	     
	     Q	  Are you focusing these press releases on states 
where there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're trying to get as many 
as we can.  It's actually quite difficult to pull this together and 
we're doing our best.  We're putting them out as we get them.
	     
	     Q	  Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole's 
schedule?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I was just following it. 
	     
	     Q	  Are press releases going along to states where he's 
visiting?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure.  I think that 
probably there are press releases going to Vermont.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting?  
(Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  George, as the President goes about the business of 
defending what's in his stimulus package, he doesn't address what 
seems to be the Republicans' main point, that you're funding it with 
deficit spending rather than "if it's so important, why not come up 
with the funding for it" seems to be the Republican argument.  And 
how do you answer that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What was answer is, we are paying 
for it over time.  And if you look at our budget, we pay for this 
package over time.  We believe right now the economy needs a jump-
start for jobs.
	     
	     Q	  You're not claiming, are you, that that doesn't add 
to the deficit this year?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm saying we're paying for it over 
time.  I didn't say that.
	     
	     Q	  I know that, George.  But I mean, from the 
beginning, the question -- we do have annual budgets and things --
deficit spending will pay for that this year, will it not?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This year they clearly will.  But 
over time our budget fully pays for this program.
	     
	     Q	  What you're saying is that there are savings that 
would cover this if it were this year in future years?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  That's exactly what I 
said.
	     
	     Q	  I know that, but there is going to be outstanding 
debt, it will add to the national debt from this year --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, we're reducing the deficit by 
$500 billion -- $514 billion over the next four years.
	     
	     Q	  You mean you're reducing it below what it would 
have been?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Exactly.
	     
	     Q	  In fact, you're adding a very large amount to the 
national debt over the period of --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But we're reducing it far more from 
what it would have been.  That's true.  
	     
	     Q	  Washington-type reduction.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  You're getting to be a grumpy old man.
	     
	     Q	  George, has any decision been made about the White 
House or the President's participation in the gay rights march coming 
up in a week and a half?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on the President's 
schedule now.  I believe he's going to be at the Senate Democratic 
retreat in Jamestown that weekend.
	     
	     Q	  Will he address it by phone?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about that.  It's a 
little far out, but I believe he's going to be in the Senate retreat.
	     
	     Q	  So will he have the leaders in a day or two before 
the speech?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I would expect that 
at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups.  
I don't know the schedule on it, though.
	     
	     Q	  Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in 
conjunction with the event?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.
	     
	     Q	  April 22nd is Earth Day.  What is the President 
going to do to mark that, and is it the case that he is going to sign 
the biodiversity treaty that day?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know there's been some work on 
the biodiversity treaty.  I don't know about signing it that day, but 
I would expect he'll have a statement on Earth Day or right around 
then.
	     
	     Q	  Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to check with Katie 
McGinty.  I just know that there's been some work done, but I don't 
know exactly what.
	     
	     Q	  When is Earth Day?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The 22nd, I think.
	     
	     Q	  Why is it you know that he is going to have a 
statement on Earth Day but you don't know if he's going to have a 
statement on the gay rights march?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I said I don't know if he's going 
to meet or when he's going to meet.
	     
	     Q	  Do you have a statement on the gay rights march?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't, actually, no.  I wouldn't 
be surprised if he did, though.
	     
	     Q	  Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a working visit on Friday and 
the President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of 
issues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and 
the trade issues between the two countries.
	     
	     Q	  There was some expectations that a second aid 
package to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G-7 meeting and, if 
I understand, it hasn't happened.  Why is that or what's the status 
on that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The G-7 meeting is still going on 
and, as you know, Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked 
about the outlines of a possible package.  But we're going to 
continue to consult with Congress and our G-7 allies on that.
	     
	     Q?	    We will not then make any kind of announcement 
during the two-day meeting?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The meeting's not over yet.  
	     
	     Q	  Is that when you're going to make one?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not ruling out the possibility.
	     
	     Q	     the President's going to announce it tomorrow.
	     
	     Q	  Bentsen said that.
	     
	     Q	  Yes, Bentsen said it would be tomorrow.
	     
	     Q	  So did Christopher.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to look at that, but I 
believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of 
Tokyo.
	     
	     Q	  George, has there been further consideration here 
about going to -- sending the President out to Los Angeles?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that there's -- it's 
not something we've ruled out.  We don't have a date set for it.
	     
	     Q	  George, you all have a position or do you support 
Immigration's plan to settle 4,000 Iraqi prisoners in the United 
States?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the first I've heard of it.
	     
	     Q	  George, there was a report today about the --
	     
	     Q	  Fortunately.  (Laughter.) 
	     
	     Q	     about the pace of appointments and says that 
President Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions 
that people have been nominated for.  Are you going to speed up the 
pace of nominations or where do you stand with it?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We filled 814 of the President's 
appointments.  And it's broken down -- we have 384 Schedule C; 147 
noncareer SES; 213 PAS full-time.  I'm not sure what that means --
(laughter) -- 70 PA full-time.  And this is about the same -- it's 
about the same pace of President Bush.  Obviously, as you move along 
farther, once you -- each level of appointment actually has a 
multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments.  So we expect 
the process to speed up.  But we're at the pace of Bush.  Obviously 
we'd like to get these done as quickly as possible.  
	     
	     I would point out that the FBI background checks and the 
background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time 
than our predecessors, and that is part of the holdup.  But we're 
working on it.
	     
	     Q	  Is that because of Nannygate?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's an awful big part of 
it, yes.
	     
	     Q	  In the story this morning, you were at 
approximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments, but way 
behind in winning confirmations.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's where the background checks 
comes into play.  That's the problem.
	     
	     Q	  That's the background checks problem?  Because I 
mean, you have a Democratic Senate --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, that's not the -- you make the 
appointments, and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all 
the forms and have the background checks done.  That's exactly where 
the problem is.
	     
	     Q	  What's the President doing this afternoon, and 
what's on the plan for tomorrow?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got some meetings -- just 
office meetings this afternoon for the most part, on a variety of 
issues that -- probably a half-dozen different issues.  And then 
he'll be -- tomorrow we'll have an event, probably again focused on 
the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House.  And 
Friday is the Miyazawa meeting.
	     
	     Q	  Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow, 
George?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Either tomorrow or Friday.
	     
	     Q	  Is there going to be a pre-briefing regarding the 
Japanese Prime Minister's visit tomorrow?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about tomorrow, but 
we'll probably get something done, as we usually do, for these 
visits.
	     
	     Q	  Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you 
know what that was about?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was here.  He met with a group 
of us here at the White House, including Mack McLarty.
	     
	     Q	  Who?
	     
	     Q	  Reverend Jackson.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Reverend Jackson.  Mack McLarty, 
me, Gene Sperling, Bruce Reed, Jeff Watson, Mark Gearan. 
	     
	     Q	  Talking about Haiti?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We talked about general urban 
policy.  He is about to go to Los Angeles.  He was just back from 
Mississippi, where we had a good victory last night; and he's going 
on to Los Angeles.
	     
	     Q	  Did he request the meeting?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Actually, no.  He's in continual 
contact with the President.  He had written a letter on a variety of 
issues, and so we asked him to come in and talk about it.
	     
	     Q	  George, Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords 
tonight in Vermont.  Have you guys been  in contact with Jeffords at 
all on this?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's been some contact, 
sure.
	     
	     Q	  Can you tell us about the contacts?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure -- 
	     
	     Q	  Do you know who contacted him or what was said?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that Howard Paster talked to 
him and they just has a general talk about the package.
	     
	     Q	  And did he express his support for it now, or is he 
--
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't divulge the details of the 
conversation, but there have been conversations.
	     
	     Q	  The L.A. Times is reporting that abortion --
elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care 
package.  Is this something the President is considering?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again --
	     
	     Q	  Along with the VAT?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's certainly something that's 
been looked at, but no decisions have been made.
	     
	     Q	  What was the question?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The L.A. Times story on whether 
abortions will be covered by the President's health plan.
	     
	     Q	  Did the President in his meeting -- did you in your 
meeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice, solicit his advice 
about what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of 
the verdict in L.A.?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we certainly talked about the 
situation in Los Angeles and the long-term prospects for economic 
development and other issues.
	     
	     Q	  For instance, did you discuss whether it would be 
helpful for the President to go there or not?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we discussed a wide range of 
issues related to Los Angeles.  That was certainly one of them.
	     
	     Q	  Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in, 
I need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, good.
	     
	     Q	     your reaction to Margaret Thatcher's comments 
that you're just sitting by and watching a massacre.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we've been pushing very hard 
on a number of fronts for more aggressive action.  We will continue 
to do that.
	     
	     Q	  Can you tell us if you've made any progress in your 
talks on the stimulus package getting a compromise?  I mean, we don't 
have any feel except talks are ongoing.  Have you talked to like 20 
people or --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the numbers.  We've 
talked to several people and we've had wide-ranging sessions.  
	     
	     Q	  Anyone leaning your way?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't get into that.  We're just 
going to keep working through Tuesday.
	     
	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.

Guido, before you have a hemmorage, maybe we can lighten up, Ok. You
have opinions as do I. Flaming at each other will not get us anywhere in
the understand of our respective positions. I offer a hand of
friendship, a truce, if it may, so that maybe we can start this
conversation like gentelmen (I am sorry if that was a mistake, from your
name I can't tell gender, you know us stupid Americans). Since you have
replied to my wife's post you must have some strong feelings about this
issue. I would like to hear them, and understand them if I can. In
return all I ask is for you to listen to me, and try to understand why I
feel the way I do.
All the yelling and all the hate about this issue just drives the sides
farther apart, till they forget why they started the fight in the first
place. If you and I can forster an understand and mutual respect for
each others views than maybe, and only then really can we come up with a
solution that is acceptable to us both.

  What, pray tell, does this mean? Just who exactly is *they*?
You mean "they" as in people who do not blindly swallow every
piece of propoganda they are given? Or "they" as in NOKD (not
our kind, dear). Or "they" as in an appeal to some audience
that is supposed to implicitly know and understand?

not eager to make a fool of myself.

  From a pragmatic standpoint, there certainly is some justification
if it is a vice people will commit anyway. Shall we criminalize
alcohol again? If the re-legalization for alcohol were done from
anything other than the pragmatic standpoint, I'd be happy to hear 
about it. The fact is that it wasn't.

  Only the first one make any sense. There is nothing to "legalize"
about all the rest. Just in case you haven't made the connection 
(which I expect you haven't) the connecting theme in this thread is
a persons autonomy over their life and body. Vice statutes serve
only to make it more expensive for the rich and more dangerous
for the poor, as Tim so eloquently put it. People will, however,
take autonomy over their lives, regardless of what the government
says.
  And why, pray tell, is AIDS "victim" in snear quotes? Are you of
the revisionist sort that thinks there is no such thing as the AIDS
plauge? Or do they just deserve it?

Reduced?  Abortion is a lot cheaper than pre-natal care and birth.
If you wanted to pay the higher premiums that would result if everyone
using their health insurance to pay for an abortion instead elected to
carry to term, I'm pretty sure that your insurance carrier would be
happy to take your money.

Fascism with a Friendly Face: Does Rush Limbaugh Remind You of 
Anyone?
Daevid Bornhuetter-Machen, The Madison Edge

"The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that 
Hitler was original and showed initiative." 
--Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show, ABC Radio Network, 
October 27, 1992.

(NLNS)--Believe it or not, I was planning this comparative review of 
Mein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant, The Way Things Ought to 
Be before Sahl issued his comparative review. As usual, Sahl's was 
independent and sharp as a scalpel.
	My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At 
least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the 
idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for 
delivery.
	Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the 
most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are 
noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with 
passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in 
fact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost 
identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German 
election). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and 
enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their 
ideological quilt.
	The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening 
pages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the 
German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway 
line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) 
was "betrayed to France by a representative of his government" when 
there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.
	In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as 
the Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost 
succeeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic 
claim in his introduction that "in a school or during a commencement 
ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional." Of 
course, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of 
God against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is 
too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.
	Of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, 
my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern 
American Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version 
of Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), 
and trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen 
million followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book 
after building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in 
Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.
	Thus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily 
three-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary 
propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way 
Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a 
translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the 
printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since 
radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of 
luxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to 
spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop 
$22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.
	But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some 
cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of 
their propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these 
days.)
	Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf 
Hess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of 
ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio 
program's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk 
show, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He 
knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows 
that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the 
opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh 
earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a 
RICO indictment.
	On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of 
material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For 
example:

On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society
	Hitler: "Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who 
individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly 
perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in 
order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of 
imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight 
for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of 
thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises" 
(page 577).
	Limbaugh: "Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The 
show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase "with half my 
brain tied behind my back to make it even"] denotes the egress of mental 
aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree 
with me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media 
will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking 
and screaming all the way." (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)

On Religion as the Basis of a Nation
	Hitler: "In this world human culture and civilization are 
inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his 
decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without 
culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord 
sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the 
expulsion from Paradise." (Page 581.)
	Limbaugh: "America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... 
But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or 
ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a 
charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools 
for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of 
American education has declined ever since?" (pages 274-5.)

On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse
	Hitler: "The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... 
One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and 
theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... 
Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays 
must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the 
service of a moral idea of State and culture." (pages 346 and 348.)
	Limbaugh: "Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that 
Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people 
who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality 
and monagamy. They disparage American heroes." (page 254.)

On the News Meida
	Hitler: "The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of 
gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass 
by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the 
people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of 
slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews." (Page 331.)
	Limbaugh: "Elements of The Media have jumped on the 
bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been 
replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During 
the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global 
network. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't 
realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that 
therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided 
and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania." (pages 270 and 268.)

*     *     *
	
To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but 
ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.
	After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that 
haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened 
Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed 
Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, 
Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to 
depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American 
radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the 
Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for 
The Fascist States of America.
	And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the 
radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only 
wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.

HS>Do you also think we shouldn't fund treatment for heart disease, since after
HS>all, those people are in that situation because of their lifestyle
HS>(overeating, lack of exercise, etc)?  What about skin cancer patients
HS>(tanning), lung cancer patients (smoking), car accident victims (driving)?

Man Heather, you are trying to make me think again. First, heart
disease, we are all going to die.

To answer your question above, why should people who are
responsible pay for the irresponsible acts of others? One
more time, if you are going to engage in an act (eating, watching the
tube, smoking, drinking, driving (drinking and driving) you should be
responsible for your actions and the conquences of that action.

HS>Why limit yourself to just situations which are related to sexual behavior?

I'am not, it is just that babies are dieing and I need to move on that
right now. Do one thing right and do it well.

HS>Shouldn't we make all the people mentioned above take all the responsibility
HS>for their situation and not ask you to pay for it, since they too chose the
HS>course they led?

Couldn't have said it better.

  _______________________________________________________________
  
  For Immediate Release	   	     	           April 14, 1993
  
  
                 TEXT OF A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
                        TO THE SPEAKER OF THE
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND
               THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE SENATE
  
  
                           April 13, 1993
  
  
  Dear Mr. Speaker:      (Dear Mr. President:)
  
  As part of my continuing effort to keep the Congress fully 
  informed, I am providing this report, consistent with section 4 
  of the War Powers Resolution, to advise you of actions that I 
  have ordered in support of the United Nations efforts in 
  Bosnia-Herzegovina.
  
  Beginning with U.N. Security Council Resolution 713 of 
  September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively 
  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security 
  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all 
  unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There 
  have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages 
  in Bosnia have been bombed.
  
  In response to these violations, the Security Council decided, 
  in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all 
  unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize 
  Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-
  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.  
  NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air 
  enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General 
  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY 
  FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating 
  allies.
  
  The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my 
  direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to 
  all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct 
  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by 
  the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces 
  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and 
  12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.  
  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. 
  e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for 
  combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.
  
  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air 
  patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early 
  Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally 
  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the 
  Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching 
  the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, 
  escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these 
  steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such 
  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by 
  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved 
  
                                more

                                  2
  
  rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will 
  be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations 
  Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was 
  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully 
  considered before the rules of engagement were approved.
  
  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such 
  operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces 
  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional 
  authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-
  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and 
  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward 
  toward attainment of our goals in this region.
  
       	    	      	   	Sincerely,
  
  
  
  
       	    	      	   	WILLIAM J. CLINTON

If you want to see environmental disasters, go to eastern Europe or some
parts of the FSU (former Soviet Union).  This is because they had no
environmental protection laws and were trying to increase productivity
at any expense to justify their political systems.  Luckily for us, some
of our politicians with vision passed some environmental laws.  That
isn't to say that they shouldn't be modified, but all I ever hear from
you is that the environmental laws were dreamed up by a bunch of
left-wing tree-huggers intent on putting us back on horseback.  Yes,
there are some of those, but a lot of us simply want to procede with
caution.

#You are making a ludicrous suggestion.

As a Latter-day Saint, I found John's statement *not at all* ludicrous...

Please allow me to explain myself.  In 1838, the governor of Missouri,
governor Boggs, issued his so-called "Mormon extermination order."  The
only crime ("illegal activity") the Latter-day Saints had committed, was
their religious affiliation, their anti-slave stance (Missouri still
allowed slave practices), and their growing numbers/influence in Missouri.

I guess the Mormons "got what they deserved," because they refused to bow
to the will of (corrupt and evil) secular authorities. This "disobedience"
brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion from
their lands and settlements...

In the 1850s, the so-called "Utah-War" was forced upon the early Mormon
settlers, and their "illegal activities" consisted no less in living as
their conscience dictated, and to be sovereign/independant in Utah's
(or "Deseret Territory" as it was called at the time) constitutional
daily affairs.  (In order to subdue this clear threat to the survival of
the United States of America, an entire army under the command of General
Johnson (hence "Johnson's Army"), invaded the territory to "restore"
Uncle Sam's law and order...)

History has the uncanny ability to draw certain parallels between events
that might appear unrelated, but are very much the same in spirit and
intent.  That same mob- or persecution-prone attitude is to be found in
this user-group: when we tried to organize "soc.religion.mormon" and/or
"talk.religion.mormon," a whole bunch of "charitable" believers effectively
blocked our intent to create a group to discuss topics related to Mormonism
et al in an appropriate forum.  We really must be a "threat" to various
establishments...  Frustrating our legitimate rights for proper representa-
tion also belongs in the category of persecution.  It is ironic that those
who oppose us, point to all kinds of "justifications" to do so, despite
their claims of adhering to a gospel of love...

In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and
I don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of their
lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from
being trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  I
may be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the
case. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds church
leader), strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-"Peace Keeper"
missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another "inspired" decision from
secular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enough
for the feds to back off.

Lest anyone believe I do not believe in government: I do, but NOT without
questioning the wisdom and constitutionality of their decisions and
resolves.  The government's actions around the Mt. Carmel compound in Waco
was NOT wise, neither was it necessary.  David Koresh did NOT pose a great
threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation, and with
John, I too wonder who or what's next...

#|> We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise

#
#Does that include the right to murder little children?  How about killing
#ATF officers?  I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas, but
#Koresh's folks claimed to have grenades, grenade launchers, and rocket
#launchers.  I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under

Who killed who?  What constitutional right did the ATF officers have to
invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound?
What REALLY caused the "murder" of the little children?  Could it be that
the ATF/FBI presence has any bearing upon the events?  How would you
interpret the Mt. Masada events?  --Blame the Jews?  (What the heck did
the Romans do there anyway?  What business did the ATF/FBI has in Waco,
Texas???)  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society.

David Koresh, no doubt, will be described as the "evil" guy (by the
executioners), while the actions of all those "valiant and brave" officers
may have been "regrettable," but alas, "necessary" to serve some dubious
public/national interest. --I guess they are still figuring it out how to

Once again, Mark, you don't specify the means through which the government
is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests.  As a 
left-wing, big government, conventional liberal, I'm just as willing as
you are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor auto
dealers.  

But what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms,
to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws,
and a desire to eliminate legislator's pay.  Each strikes me as a 
particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special
interests cannot influence public policy.  In fact, they seem clearly
designed to accomplish the opposite.

Larry,

One pays insurance to pay for coverage one expects/fears one might need.
If one is opposed to abortion, one should not be required to pay for
"coverage" of it because one will NEVER want to use that "service" and
neither should that person be COMPELLED to pay for other people's
abortions PARTICULARLY if one sincerely believes that abortion is
murder.

Phill, here in Indiana, where we not only have CCWs (permits to
carry firearms), but we also have a fairly low crime rate.  At any one
given point the occupants in my vehicles are likely to be armed.
I've never had to use my gun, but am prepared to do so if I am
attacked.  In essence, I'm quite prepared.  I also have, in the glove
box, my proof of insurance, as mandated by Indiana law.  So, if I got
into an accident and had to whip out my insurance policy to prove that
I can pay for any damages I may have caused will you "wonder why I'm
so prepared for an accident"?  Even where it not Indiana law I would
still be carrying my automobile insurance.  I also wear my seatbelt.
Does that make me bad for "preparing for an accident"?

Yes, I have!  Wasn't there a case of a single lion ruling all the land
from South Africa up to Egypt across to the congo?  If my memory serves
me correctly there was enough game to feed some 100,000 or more lions but he
wouldn't let the other lions hunt as he wanted it all himself.

He died of a heart attack brought on by being overweight.

Good thing too as he had designs on Europe, America (north and south),
and the Falkland Islands.

Are you implying above that Arab leaders are gays? Aren't there Jewish gays too?

Don't understand the concept of insurance, do you Anthony?

What is insurance for?

To spread the cost of illness/accident/etc that does occur in a small
percentage of cases, over many.  Those who do not face the accident/etc
have peace of mind that they would not be devestated if they did, those
who do face the accident/etc *are* not devestated (financially anyhow) 
in dealing with it.

This 'irresponsible' label in reference to normal but rare life occurances is
stupid.  Bad things happen to good people, too, you know.

Agreed.

It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any
reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams.  Just
as Marxism "fails" to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and
the state is to "wither away," libertarians frequently fail to show how
weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human
condition.

This is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds.  In this case,
"limited" and "big" government are not defined.  I would point out that
Lebanon, Somalia, and the former Yugoslavia are by some definitions nations
with "limited" government, while the US, Canada, and nations in Western 
Europe (where "people would rather live") are often pointed out as 
nations with "big government" from a libertarian point of view.  

The argument is not between those who want "limited" government and those
who want "unlimited" government.  It is between those who believe
government regulation in a capitalist economy serves worthwhile ends and
those who believe such regulation is neither desirable on empirical 
grounds nor justifiable on ideological grounds.

You think that you all have it bad....here at good ol' Southwest Missouri
State U., we have 2 parties running for student body president.  There's the
token sorority/fraternity faces, and then there's the president and vice
president of NORML.  They campaigned by handing out condoms and listing
their qualifications as,"I listen really well."  It makes me sick to have
a party established on many of the things that are ruining this country like
they are.  I think I'll run next year.:(

In the case of victimless crimes yes, I think so.

Think about it.  If I rob or beat up or rape or kill someone, it's very
clear to anyone not a sociopath that I've done something immoral.  On the
other hand, if I smoke grass or have sex with a consenting adult in a
manner illegal in that state, the morality or immorality of that act is
merely a lifestyle choice; it doesn;t clearly hurt anyone else.  IMO, if
such an act doesn;t hurt another person it should not be interfered with.

I think so.  And I don't use drugs, outside of the legal ones (alcohol
and coffee).

	I've never seen CNN give out the poll questions on the air.
If you sent them a letter asking for them, you might get them.  Here's
my guess of how part of a session might look:

Question: Do you approve of Clinton's performance?
Answer: No
Questions: Do you disapprove due to the gays in the military issue?
Answer: Yes

Conclusion: Clinton has a low approval rating because he's not moving
fast enough on gays in the military.


	I think any group truly dedicated to reporting the news would
not use manufactured news like polls.

OOooooHhhh!  He admits it!  The infamous "first step".  Let's look at
it this way.  I have never harmed anyone with my firearms.  I have
successfully defended myself with them.  I have successfully procurred
food with them.  I have successfully had much enjoyment in target
practicing with them.  

In that order firearms are important to me.  Friend, I was raped as a
child by an older child who had a knife.  That ain't never gonna
happen again.  There is no one, including yourself, who will *ever*
make me a victim again.  As long as you don't try to make me a victim,
I will leave you alone.  But if you *ever* try to make me a victim,
I'll fight you all the way, such as I'm doing now.  And I'll fight you
with a response appropriate to the situation.  Now, you aren't
advocating making me a victim are you?  Exactly what are you doing?

Fishing rights are disputed.  Between 2 nations, no matter *how* 
friendly, there is ALWAYS fishing disputes.

What I was getting at was the 54 40' or fight slogan is OLD STUFF
dealing with the LAND dispute.  No one is saying 54 40' or fight 
about fishing rights.  The territorial dispute about the Oregon
Territory (we called it) is LONG resolved.

Fishing rights...small potatoes.

Summary: GM's quest for justice

	A judge denied GM's new trial motion, even though GM says it has two
new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the impact, not
from the fire.

	Thoughts?

	It's kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start
denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led
to the previous ruling appear.

	Or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed? 
Shouldn't that be up to a jury?

	And what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk
shows proclaiming their obvious bias against GM?  Shouldn't that be enough for
a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial?

	Whatever happened to jurors having to be objective?

Go for it.  I have yet to see anybody justify the
prohibition on drugs and the ensuing War On Drugs.  In the world of
*.politics here on Usenet, it is YOU that is crazy.  ANYBODY--who gives
the matter any thought beyond reading headlines---cannot justify this
atrocity, this all out war on individual rights.

Just _TRY_ to justify the War On Drugs, I _DARE_ you!

I don't know about everybody else, but to me, they should have been

This is similar to my saying that Clinton's timber summit does little to
fix the health care problem.  Look at the whole picture, not just
randomly picked libertarian positions.  If government is not allowed to
use "non-initiated force" to achieve its goals, than no special interest
can influence the government to use non-initiated force on their behalf.

The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic
which I'll address briefly.  It certainly won't happen until
libertarianism is the dominate philosophy.  What means do we have to
make libertarianism the dominate philosophy?  Statists run the education
monopoly, so we have to be creative.  The Advocates for Self-Government
reports 85% of their Seminar 1 participants "embrace" libertarianism.
That's the best means I've seen yet.  We should lobby for compulsory
Seminar 1 attendance. :) [in jest!]

It's amazing to me that governments around the world will try every
aspect of government control before, as a final last resort after
everything else fails, they will try individual liberty.

How about connections between BCCI and TCI?  Reference to the BCCI
money laundering appears in an insert in an article about the TCI
cable company and its sharp -- and possibly illegal -- business
practices.  The article is in the 27-Jan-92 issue of the Wall Street

True.  But forcing her to remain pregnant continues the violation of

Canada's GST is collected as a sales tax and is considered a VAT.
Funnily, the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was
never referred to as a tax (or, people never paid mind to it,
thus the uproar when it was brought up front as the GST --- 
one party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again).

The stated intent of the Tories was to use the GST to write down
our deficit.  Unfortunately, their legislation didn't include any
mechanism for disbursing the collected funds in such a manner and
the money is now sitting in escrow.  I don't know what is involved
in releasing the funds, but one dilemna is that the Tories are not
fiscal conservatives themselves though while taxing and spending,
they've made moves to apply the breaks to a runaway locomotive by
the end of this time --- the end of their second term (~9 years).
While they do have chances of getting a third term, catching up
in the polls to their more moderate/slightly leftish pro-business
rivals, the Liberals (as in Euro/UK), the Tories' heir-apparent 
for the leaders' mantle has been termed a clone of Hillary 
Clinton ...

Those areas became states.

Puerto Rico has the population needed to become a state.  But the ethnic
mix there is such that Puerto Rico will probably never become a state.

I say we cut them loose.  If they don't want to become a state, we
shouldn't continue to subsidize their existence.

Do you have a cite for the case?  You don't give enough
information to be able to compare the two situations.
If the demonstrators had been blaring loud rock music 
into the landlord's home all day and night, then I could
see how the opinion would be justified.  But this court
order had prohibited abortion protesters from displaying
pictures of dead fetuses, which doesn't disrupt the privacy
of anyone inside the clinic.  

> He pointed out that

Perhaps in the privacy of their homes, but not on public
property.  Did the Korean grocery store owner in New York
city have a right to be free from the speech of the protesters 
outside his store?  Patrons inside the store could hear the 
protesters asking them to re-consider shopping there -- how 
is that different from the abortion protesters asking women 
to re-consider getting an abortion at a clinic?

Even if the protesters' speech could be considered
"harassment" (which it is not), hate speech laws have 
generally been struck down by the courts.  I don't see 
how the words ``don't kill your baby'' or ``abortion is 
murder'' could be considered harassment.

Some of the protesters were arrested for simply praying
quietly on a public sidewalk.  Yeah, I could see how
that might be equivalent to "bombing" and "murder".
Uh huh.  Let us know when you get a grip on reality.

By such things, do you mean any use of military forces against US

     Really?  What if it said "lentil eating" or "legume eating",
     what then? 
     And I suppose "Accept 10" is anti-Octal bigotry?

If I hold a gun to your wife, would you respond the same way? I don't

age of peace love and harmony hasn't hit in South Central LA nor has it
hit in former Yugoslavia. And as long as there are people in the world
who would rather see me dead than thrive, I want the protection of a
police force who will keep the peace so I *can* make love without being

The ultimate statement for equal rights (something many of the feminazis
have forgotten) is "I do not care if you are either a man or a woman,
I do not care if you are black or white, I do not care if you are gay
or straight." Once you can honistly say "I do not care about color,
race, or gender or sexual preference", then we will truly be on the
right track.

Keep shoving differences in my face and then expect us all to get along?
Get real! So long as you try to make me care if you are black, female,
or whatever, I am going to continue to balk. It's natural human behaviour.

But the moment employers searching for employees, banks looking to lend
money, and theClinton administration looking for appointees can honistly
say "I do not care about your color, race, gender, or sexual preferences;
I instend instead to treat you as a human being," crap like last year's
riots will continue to happen.

>1.   HEY MAN, ACADAMIA RULES!!

Barf.

You mean the same economic theorists who say things like "for the sake
of convenience in mathematical modeling we will first assume there is
no wealth creation" now get a crack at implementing their PhD thesis in
real life?

Go back to your textbooks on macroeconomic theory. Look in the first chapter
of that book, introducing the field of macroeconomic theory. Right there
in chapter 1, section 1, is a statement like the following:

	"As it is difficult to predict and model wealth creation,
	especially in an economy where wealth creation is inherently
	the province of individuals who create new inventions and
	discover new ideas, we will assume for the rest of this
	book that there is no wealth creation.

	"We do not assume the lack of weath creation in the real world,
	however the mathematical modeling of such an inherently
	unpredictable subject is impossible. Even though we assume
	no wealth creation, we do believe that for most mathematical
	economic modeling such an assumption is reasonably valid
	as it allows us to make predictions which then can be tested."

So the guys who are running the store for Clinton and company are now
assuming that wealth creation does not exists. They are (borrowing an
idea from the Hitchhiker's Guide) too advanced to think of these simple
things.

To be honist, I would rather have an engineer with years of experience
building bridges design the next bridge, rather than a theoretical
physicists with a freshly minted PhD and no experience do the same job.

Yes, that is most certainly true. However, the paragrapgh reflects a value-less
position and infers that what is more important than anything else is to
have "a positive view" of one's self.

This of course, is foolish.

Should a mass murderer, a pedophile, a 10-year old pyromaniac have a "positive
view" of themselves?

Of course not.

A person that engages in behaviour that a large number of people condemn,
and IF you believe in the concept of "society", then your only choice is
to expect that person to have a negative view of themselves.

Since the actual verdicts were not known by the authorities, it was
smart not to allow "Friday night for fighting" (sorry, Elton) and to
seal them for this morning.  Also, it allows for maximum daylight to
wear down and frustrate any potential troublemakers, as well as give
more preparation time.

We had cutovers to LA's KNBC on our WNBC, and I didn't recall this

A net-contact in L.A. tells me that the alert will remain over this
weekend, as some elements may find excuse over the not-guilty verdicts
on three of five charges (the aiding-and-abetting).  Those acquittals
seem to balance out the fact that Rodney King himself was not any kind
of angel that night, speeding and fleeing et al.  However ...  Another
consideration is any street celebrations over the two convictions on
the excessive force charges (Koons for incompetance, and Powell for
overreacting --- both guilty as heck even from the view of NYPD cops
interviewed) that might get out of hand. )-;  Also, some elements
may take the acquittals as an excuse to challenge the cops (a dumb
move, obviously).  And, Koreans are still scared and certain people
are really mad over how they have armed themselves in the last year.

A Commander from Nassau, Long Island was questioned about how his
people would have handled Rodney King, and he said "We'd have let
him roll around in the dirt 'til he got tired, then handcuff him".

Oh, no, not in this case. I've noticed that you conveniently edited out your
stupid comment that the PRC stands for Cambodia. When we're arguing the
Vietnam war and about Cambodia, and you toss in a boner like that (along
with your other boners), you are an ignorant asshole.

Oh, and even the Vietnamese agree that they did far more damage to
Cambodia than we ever did.

Uh, well, Golly Gee Whiz. Let me see, when the new President, as his first

military, despite polls showing a consistent 75%+ against it, and the
minority is only 1%, well, gee, I sure think that is newsworthy.

Hmm, you still don't get it. Then again, I'm not posting from a  University

Tell me, committed any anti-semitic acts today? What kind of boots do you

And still -- Libertarians want the State out of their lives. Parents are very
capable of protecting their children against the predations of pedophiles,
which, BTW, you still haven't disassociated yourself from.

There is no need to include the VAT from previous levels because
the VAT is a "difference" tax...if the VAT is X%, than the amount
of tax the government receives through all the levels is X% of
the purchase price of the end consumer.  At the intervening levels,
only the difference between the VAT paid out and the VAT received
is remitted to the government.

A VAT is infinitely preferable to a retail sails tax...

Just to follow up on Casper's posting. I have been following this business
since it started 52 days ago.  The Branch Davidians have occupied the Mt.
Carmel location for some years, and their neighbors (you know, the people
next door) have said to a man, that the BD folks were quiet and never
bothered anybody.

There were some defector from the BD who alleged child abuse within the
movement, but how does this bring in the Feds? In particular what interest
would ATF have in child abuse. O.K. It was the allegation of possesing
illegal automatic weapons.  A search warrant could have been obtained
(properly) only on probable cause. This means that some evidence that an
illegal auto weapon was shipped in, or an illegal kit for converting
semi-auto weapons to full automatic was purchased or shipped.

In either case, how does this require an NO-KNOCK warrent, with a bunch of
macho hot dog assholes busting into the place *without* identifying
themselves. Milleniests tend to be a bit paranoid anyway. It is no
surprise they shot when invaded. Hell I am not a religious extremist and I
might have done the same myself. If the DEA busted into my house by
mistake without identifying themselve and I had a gun in my hand, I would
shoot first and wonder later.

So if it was illegal guns, the ATF should have gotten a normal warrant
(how can you flush a 50 calibre machine gun down the toilet?) and
presented it in a peaceful normal way. David Koresh has had brushes with
the law, even standing trial for attempted murder in which he was
acquitted. In every prior brush with the law, Koresh and his people acted
peacibly. There was no prior action on the part of the BD folks to
indicate that they were any danger to society.

NOTE: The question of whether the BD people were religious extremists or
slight daft is totally irrelevant. It is *not* against the law to be
looney or zany.

Look and learn folks. And be VERY afraid.

In responding to the post below I have considered issues far outside the
scope of revisionism and principally have considered the political
implications of a racist ideology and its inevitable outcome. Thus it
is tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directed
followups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political
lessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.

Let us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does
this mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder
because he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent
supporter?

One of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system
was far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party
itself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was
noone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not
originaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it
until his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged
upon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of 
his supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the
old guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications
of their rhetoric. 

This is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must
be considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one "race"
of people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of
humanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,
the gas chambers of Auschwitz.

The NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who
lead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the
evil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.
Hitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego
cult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however
mean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and
his propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can
produce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be 
emphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between
a govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to 
govern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the
latter as a "strong" government since most displays of strength are made
necessary by an essential weakness.

It is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they
amoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the
same manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause
of morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their
logic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties
such as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert
the truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates
of a system that would commit genocide. 

The conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is
inescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let
the conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that
were basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of
the concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly
does not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.

No matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon 
election those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.
If this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made
the pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates
a dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many
in government politics is a method of providing a justification for
their own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A 
rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the
continued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the
essential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli
which has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important
to realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right
and those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement
of popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.
In the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through
their assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.

It is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics
of political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The
leaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do
so voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a 
task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of
ones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore
in taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole
before personal concerns, even of personal security.

Although it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred
and an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit
genocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of
the system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility
of changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to 
control a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot 
affect the system.

What suburban kid would want to hold down a minimum wage job when there is so
much more money to be made dealing drugs?

Yet, somehow, surburban kids do hold down minimum wage jobs.  So do inner
city kids, when give the chance.  Any reason you think that inner city kids
are incapable of doing legitimate work?

No one is a "rioter" until they participate in a "riot", which is 
unlikely to happen, now.

Most of the *people* in L.A. are likely to have gotten up early to 
listen to the court announcement.

I don't think he was told.
However, his statement was still appropriate.

Jury duty is a solemn duty to be taken seriously.  It is not meant

Well, the many *people* who got up early to go to the court to hear

       This seems a strange argument to make considering that Canada's
violent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the U.S.  (Our
non-gun crime rate is greater than their *entire* crime rate).  It
would seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of gun
control laws.

       I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural and
enforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and then
that reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.

>Given that most

       Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished
because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a
crime with it a silly solution, it still doesn't address the
question of Canada.  (Which is now, by the way, blaming their rising
gun-crime rate on the U.S.  Strange that the border used to "magically"
keep the guns out, but now isn't.)

>It certainly makes

       The other side of the coin, of course, is that far "illegal drugs"
are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally. 
I've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals
have shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources
(stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simply
see South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as
well, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.

of it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come
to mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost
entirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed
for poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you
compared the white majority they were virutally identical.

        The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs.
non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative
conditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of
nomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into
account that the non-whites in either city were not living in the
same conditions.

        If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns,
then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which are
arguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far
higher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only
not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly
lower.

       The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. "inner-city"
problems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a condition
which is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent
crime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control
is the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As one
Canadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun control
in 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase
in violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparently
they didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in
the early eighties.

>>  -most violent crime occurs in areas with strict gun control already

       True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., where
gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that
crime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.

       The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high
or low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact
violent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than it
was going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by
saying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be instituted
to deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, you
can't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of
that gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control
was implemented, just as happened in Canada.

>Similar or worse rates exist in cities with poor gun control.

       As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent
of gun control.

       Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what
others did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would
sell to them?

       Horrors, appealing to popular principles.  Can we perhaps as the
question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal
to the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written
with something else in mind and "propoganda" put out by its supporters.

       But let's be honest about something, here.  When was the last time
you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?

       Or are they simply propogranda?  We can't know what Phill *really*
means because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince.

       If they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why
on earth did you make a point of calling them "propogranda?"  That
would seem to be irrelevent.

       Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe
they no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were
good arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because
they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't
think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.

       Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political
system, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this
particular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure
and tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)

        In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have

        Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While
the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although
badly) to the U.S. President.

        Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives
is "in principle" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate)
but in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the
Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh
darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put
those extra restrictions on the Senate in?

      Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell
you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of
government to "attack" which presents them with the best chance of
getting what they want.  With national "interest groups" it is simply
a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a
law rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less 
"contributions" to make.  

      Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at
the Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little
state battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance,
medicine, and most other questions.

      Local government has not "failed" in that it hasn't done what it
should, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local
interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their
rules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout,
only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because
it can impose its will on the lower.

      I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres
of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus-
and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed
to a local crime?

      The more people want the more Congress will take power to "sell"
it to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of "special interests"
is coincidence with the increased power of Congress.

       Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual
need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher
levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to
in effectiveness.

       Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I
remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable
of educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if
you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the "pork" in that
state.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power
and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get
what they want, individual voices have more relative impact.

       The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must "buy off"
states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.

       But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself 
that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres
has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact
national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem
is significantly reduced.

>The current blocks on power simply absolve congress of any responsibility
>to come to a decision. 

       The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable
to action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering
the government the usually the institution with the sole power to
enforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those
decisions a good thing.

>Pushing the decisions lower in the pyramid won't
>work unless the lower levels are less corrupt. In most cases they are worse,
>not better.

       The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have
more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution
than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is
harder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing
new deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out
without a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the
entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different
areas, different solutions may be called for.

       And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local
and state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to
the city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the
majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end
up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in
Washington with half a million or more constituents.

       I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels
are more corrupt.

       Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were
arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators
should be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was
suppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was
nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this.
Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders
wanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them,
I never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution,
which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for
the House.

       The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration
of Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other
examples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the
reasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)

       To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something
it wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering
the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they
want them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying
about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which
almost necessitates its abuse.

       *BUSH?*  Phill, that's absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of
which was over-ridden.  Go read up on FDR if you think that's
anything resembling a record.

       Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system
against action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when
dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have
not been successful.  When you're in a position of imposing federal
power on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to
got through something more than a bare majority

       Now we're switching from a general question of a fillibuster
to a specific bill.  I don't see how it make a difference.

       Sure it's arguable.  Theyr'e *arguing* it.  However, requiring
60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they'll have to have a *good*
argument.  Something that isn't based solely on party lines.

       No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority
for *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population
groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities
should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough
about.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don't advocate the minority
being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing
the *federal* system against action.

You selfish little bastard. Afraid you might have to sacrafice somthing
for your country. What someone not approve a lone for you ? To bad.
What is immoral is: people like you and the current president who don't
have any idea why this country still exists after 200+ years.

Sigh.  It's so amusing to watch bigots point fingers at what they imagine to
be other bigots.  I do believe this person meant "bean *counting*".  And are
you trying to suggest that only Hispanics eat beans?  Or that they even have
a monopoly on eating beans?  Or that this person is seriously promoting what
is obviously a tongue-in-cheek .sig?

You must have a brain somewhere, if you can cause your fingers to type.  Use
it.

What in the Tree makes you think we queers CAN'T experience that commitment? 
What's stopping us from committing to one partner for the rest of our lives? 
I have every intention of doing so, once I find the right person...and
whether that person is male or female, I seriously doubt that a church
ceremony/public vow/licence will make any difference whatsoever in the sort
of commitment I experience with that person.  You have no conception of the
difference marriage makes since you have never known any other way.

     I'm curious why you took a beign statement and cross-posted it to several
different news groups, including something along the lines of alt.discrimination  Look Rodney King is black and large.  I have several large black male friends,and they are referred to as being large black men ( to their faces, and by
themselves ).  You know, Ted, I have a large number of adjectives for you,
but I will spare you most of them because I try not to get into personal
flame wars.  Let me just say that I think your action of cross posting this
was total BS, and you're trying to start some crap.  Hopefully, others will
see through your trite little game and not play along.

	Alan, you can start by teaching your children that the perpetrators
of crimes no more represent the "Black community" than racist hateful Whites
represent the majority culture (although there are many ethnic minorities
who have fallen into the very trap that you are struggling with, and believe
otherwise). The trap is the easy way out.
	For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the
demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,
and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're
going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic
group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors
leading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than
not, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.
	If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few
Blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime
statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then
worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable
or whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to
define "us" and "other" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous
when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational
humans.
	It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the
*most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial
makeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in
San Francisco, a city that loves to tout its "ethnic diversity". Here, we
have Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the "model minority") gangs,
and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly
troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their
propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on
the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and
crime are what they most fear. During the "disturbance" in Los Angeles last
year many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I
remember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs
where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned
from TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives
that live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly
multi-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that
in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*
riot!
	In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points
that really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the
racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As
a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem
becomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly
believe that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current
course of denial and repression.
	I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors,
luck in avoiding the "trap". 
	Peace, my brother.

First, the only drug that could possibly be put in drug stations are marijuana 
or its derivitives.  Every other drug that I can think of can kill you if you 
take to much.  (By the very nature of these drugs, your decision making skills 
aren't up to par.  That is how it differs from asprin, flinstone vitamins, etc.
We don't even allow penicilin to be sold over the counter.)

Second, we already have a big enough drunk driving and alchoholic problem in 
this country.  If marijuana were legal, undoubtedly more people would use it, 
and that IS a problem.  People use it, get stupid, and hurt other people.

In regard to Woody's post, I thought I would remind him of something in
the midst of his tirade against academia:
As a member of the generation likely to pay for the crap Reagan and his cronies started with the deficit according to the brilliant Laffer curve (NOT!) I
think we need to look with open minds upon any ideas which will allow us
to directly address the problems of the gigantic federal deficit and debt and
continue to allow our economy to expand--and I don't remember Woody and co.
complaining about academia while Laffer implemented his policy, Stockman
approved it while being fully aware the numbers not adding up, and Reagan
completing the largest con job of the century which my generation and I will now have to pay for.

Wrong.  In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health
insurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like
socialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary
insurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition
has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,
including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,
you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.
With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and
be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The
public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount
for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or
according to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of
French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health
costs in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other
taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures
for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure
for the U.S.

That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund
is to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back
in Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health
insurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff
of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly "libertarian"
faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that
just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average
Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American
counterparts on issues like these).

I'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about
leftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian
newsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100%
insurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know
it, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American
conservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who
seriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about the
Americans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans
who spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that
shouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for
insurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that
the Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite
being open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to
spend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a
different culture.

"Managed Care" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most western
nations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France
and Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says
of HMO/NHS approaches, "We left that behind with East Germany!").
Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling
doctors with budget strings.

In Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France
and Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public
hospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisions
are different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked
"sickness funds" over a century old while Canada divides by their
provinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the
doctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)

With such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to
the U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The
French and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations
in more compact geography to improve scales of economy.

The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.

Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really
why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance
in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT
has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude
lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American
doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple
(early March).

Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French
and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is
it because too many people take French and German in college to make
the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance.
Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when
the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors
were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength
rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized
medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.

For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why
certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't
make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance
rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical
monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they
must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking
of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the
U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis
E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.

Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's
health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one
small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.

Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany
case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public
sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra
insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward
accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal
benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be
covered for basic care.

At that point, they wouldn't even consider a "voucher" approach
to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up
the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.

It is "free" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two
things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like
real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when
working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying
for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my
pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only
annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal
naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for
that is part of their brainwashing agenda.

The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer 
1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance
coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 
1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%
afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private
hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital
rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same
cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid
out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.
Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,
the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not
gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and
private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that
yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.

Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its
just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada
and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because
there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.

When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the
risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe
amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on
the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat
themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec
last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against
any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's
public health insurance plan.

I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware
that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees
were listed seperately on my pay stub.

While I'm not the only Canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks
in spending, health insurance isn't on the table.  See our polls ...
A better one might be the July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our
major English newsmagazine) by Decima Research ... Decima president
Allen Gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers,
and Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in
the face of impossible election situations.  I haven't had a chance
to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones
before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had
shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private
system had support within statistical noise.  The Decima polls are
considered definitive.  Even the new Reform Party, a breakoff of
traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly "libertarian"
faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that
just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average
Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American
counterparts on issues like these).

Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used
in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in
a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a
lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic
health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does
allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on
the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.  Plenty of
room is left for expenditure of private funds as extra insurance or as

Please explain this one, hopefully in a way that Canadian readers
besides myself can understand and concur ...

For Immediate Release                         April 17, 1993     

	     
                    INTERVIEW OF THE PRESIDENT
                      BY MICHAEL WHITELY OF
                    KDKA-AM RADIO, PITTSBURGH
	     
                 Pittsburgh International Airport
                     Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania    



10:40 A.M. EDT
	     
	     
	     Q	  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike 
Whitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh 
International Airport and with me is the President of the United 
States Bill Clinton.
	     
	     And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.
	     
	     Q	  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk 
about in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just 
breaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been 
kind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in 
the trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard 
that two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and 
Officer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been 
found not guilty.
	     
	     It's a situation that's been building for over a 
year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  
And I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see 
the situation in Los Angeles in connection with your 
administration and what you're trying to do.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the 
American people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a 
tribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the 
efforts of the federal government in developing the case.
	     
	     The law under which the officers were tried is a 
complex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury 
decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible 
for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did 
most of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked 
Rodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some 
blows, and another officer who was a rookie.
	     
	     No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but 
it appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They 
acknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think 
that the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But 
I hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  
first of all, the importance of trying to bring this country 
together and not violate the civil rights of any American; 
secondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.  
	     
	     I think it's important to recognize that in the 
poorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this 
country, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're 
even more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our 
efforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police 
officers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a 
waiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some 
other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to 
violence and drugs.
	     
	     And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to 
me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic 
revitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed 
areas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles 
who wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many 
problems as we do.  
	     
	     And I laid out a very ambitious program in the 
campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment 
to bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, 
Ron Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies 
for that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest 
unemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the 
country.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to 
the new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several 
other people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with 
regard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.
	     
	     Q	  Let's talk about what brings you to the 
Pittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a 
lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  
You've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you 
said earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break 
that gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to 
Allegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that 
battle?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First 
of all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported 
me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in 
economic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it 
gives the country a very different budget for the next five years 
than we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, 
at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and 
health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.
	     
	     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the 
short run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money 
to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; 
to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also 
to try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The 
plan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the 
Senate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a 
bloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come 
to a vote.
	     
	     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote 
for the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican 
leader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to 
stay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases 
the deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending 
targets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for 
this year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five 
years.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the 
economy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that 
are holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for 
billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --
much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.
	     
	     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  
I've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I 
think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work 
right now to show that we're changing the direction of the 
country.  And that's the purpose of the bill.
	     
	     Q	  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or 
his office lately?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk 
regularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison 
operation to the senators that we think are open to this --
Senator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords 
from Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six 
others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and 
know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life 
of the budget I presented.
	     
	     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've 
got a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth 
is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life 
of the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we 
have this program well below the spending targets that Congress 
has already approved for this year.  And they've done this for 
years, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans 
voting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as 
putting the American people back to work.  
	     
	     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political 
issue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and 
the need for jobs.
	     
	     Q	  I have some questions from people who supported 
you, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  
It has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot 
of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I 
think some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the 
White House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go 
through.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And 
they're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull 
it off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew 
it was going to be like this.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask 
people, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving 
very fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the 
fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in 
history, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we 
are moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on 
political reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole 
wide range of things.  
	     
	     But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn 
it around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions 
which led to the victory I received from the people in November, 
and we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making 
real, real progress.  
	     
	     I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  
We're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going 
to happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing 
things.
	     
	     Q	  Thank you very much.  
	     
	     The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, 
here live at Pittsburgh International Airport.  I'm Mike Whitely, 
KDKA News.

                  RADIO ADDRESS TO THE NATION 
                        BY THE PRESIDENT

10:06 A.M. EDT
             
             
             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to
you this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio
station in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to
meet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,
health care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly
broadcast with the American people. 
             
             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when
it reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past
seven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with
the people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus
tour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last
year's campaign.
             
             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with
you, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and
what I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting
to you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.
             
             You sent me to Washington to get our government and
economy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad
experiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important
it is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do
business.  
             
             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations
rise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness
of their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the
cooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,
labor and government.  Although many of the economies of the
industrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've
made many of the smart investments and the tough choices which
our government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them
have been moving ahead and too many of our people have been
falling behind.
             
             We have an economy today that even when it grows is
not producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation
by four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to
show for it.  We know that wages of most working people have
stopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks
and that too many families can no longer afford the escalating
cost of health care.
             
             But we also know that, given the right tools, the
right incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and
businesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy
needs to expand opportunity and to make our communities better
places to live.
             
             In many critical products today Americans are the
low cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that
we create more of those kinds of jobs.
             
             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for
long-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old
priorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to
be -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs
and education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the
waste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious
resources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the
groundwork for robust economic growth in the future.
             
             These new directions passed the Congress in record
time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our
country.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would
create hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private
sector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It
now has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. 
But it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the
Senate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know
would result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.
             
             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. 
Millions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and
counting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill
has been grounded by gridlock.  
             
             I know the American people are tired of business as
usual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin
or wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have
taken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra
mile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25
percent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  
             
             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million
Americans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill
languish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean
hundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to
act to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking
this initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I
think we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant
portion of our original goals.
             
             First, we want to keep the programs as much as
possible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,
including highway and road construction, summer jobs for young
people, immunization for children, construction of waste water
sites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding
for extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who
have been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't
creating jobs.
             
             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs
in the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40
percent.
             
             And third, I've recommended a new element in this
program to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against
crime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire
police officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put
them back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight
for a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it
and deserve it.
             
             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --
the Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it
increases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this
year that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,
doesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more
than paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this
budget is well within the spending limits already approved by the
Congress this year.
             
             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators
who are filibustering the bill voted during the previous
administration for billions of dollars of the same kind of
emergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the
American people to work.  
             
             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered
a plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities
are -- on people or on politics.  
             
             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar
for dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the
soundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our
children.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs
and investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of
us when we've helped make more American partners working to
ensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.
             
             You know, if every American who wanted a job had
one, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this
country today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first
step to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country
again.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid
for over the life of our budget.
             
             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how
important the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.
             
             Good morning, and thank you for listening.

                               END                 10:11 A.M. EDT

 Not quite.  The answer is:  Many homosexuals, heterosexual, and bisexuals are,
but then, many are not.

 Or, more simply: Lots of people are.

It is a bit unfair to call blame the Clinton Administration alone...this

a bipartisan effort of the establishment Demopublicans and
Republicrats...the same bipartisan effort that brought the S&L scandal,

Reasonable doubt dates back to Human Rights. We are now in the time of
Civil Rights. Civil Rights are issued by the State with whatever strings
attached they choose as the Grantor of said rights. And if that means that 
verdicts are determined by the needs of the state rather than by guilt or 
innocence in a traditional sense, so be it. Being subjective rather than 
objective may make it harder to anticipate what is right, and you may be 
sacrificed for being wrong inadvertantly once in a while, but that really is a 
small price to pay for the common good don't you think?

Thats the point. If there are several million queers in DC you had better
start wondering about the validity of the study.

So if this study is proved wrong then it proves that heterosexuals
are liars? Unlike the propaganda spouted by the far right the ten
percent figure was backed up by the best study available at the time.
Its hardly certain that this new study is correct since it hasn't
even been out for enough time for any double checking to happen.

Of course if they had found 10% then it would be invalid because it
was funded by planned parenthood :)

Even if its "only" one million the point still stands. Even getting
1/6th of a given population in one place would be unprecidented. 
If even 1 million show up in DC it will raise serious doubts about
this study, or indicate a resolve unprecidented in human history.

He isn't the target of the march, nor do presidents often speak at

the republicans and conservative democrats would do well to take
notice.

	The IAEA has two conflicting goals.  One is to promote the
spread of nuclear energy, the other to police its use.  Any successful
policing, ie, finding cheaters, shows that its other arm is being
overzealous in its promotion of nuclear energy.

	The IAEA announces in advance which sites it will visit.  It
allows the country it is inspecting to veto areas on the list, by
claiming they are not used for nuclear work.  Its inspectors are drawn
from all over the world, and few have any experience in bomb building.
Such experience would make the job of determining if a site was being
used for military purposes much easier.

	Unfortunately, many countries object to knowledgeable
inspectors, because the only really knowledgeable inspectors come from
about 10 countries.

	There was an excelent article on the Feb 1 1993 New Yorker on
why the IAEA fails to do its job.

Of course, one again faces the question of how one circumscribes government
power (and keeps it circumscribed) in a complex society when it is in the 
interest of neither capitalists nor consumers to refrain from using 
government power for their own ends.  But apart from that little 
conundrum...

It would seem that a society with a "failed" government would be an ideal
setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented.  Now why do you suppose
that never seems to occur?...

I wouldn't call it "vague."  I'd call it elastic.  All "regulation" is 
not necessarily the same.  By opposing all government regulation, some 
libertarians treat every system from a command economy to those that
regulate relatively free markets as identical.  That's one reason
many of the rest of us find their analysis to be simplistic.

Overlooking entirely that there is nothing to prevent anyone from

As it should be.  They have a homicide rate that is a couple of orders
of magnitude lower then this country's (as does almost everyone else
in the world).  But I suppose that it's too unreasonable to suppose
that a lower availability of handguns has anything to do with that fact.

Right.  Remember those riots a while back?  Remember what they were

those Canadians living under the terribly oppressive regime up north).

This show is just part of the American propaganda against any
government run by Muslims (Iran, Sudan, Algeria (remember democracy?)
Pakistan, Palestine (sorry, Occupied Territories), and many others.
We must stop this idea that a government which does not fully
agree with American policies is not evil and dangerous as the media
attempts to portray it.

I'm not sure why you don't consider it an option.  No one suggests that
such analysis should be left to "regulators."  In fact, the "re-inventing
government" movement provides just such a cost/benefit approach to the
analysis of public spending.  Libertarians would do well to learn more
about it.

Sorry, but it strikes me that it is the only "feasible" approach.  What is
not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and 
licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent
tasks.

Actually, the only areas of public spending above that strike me as 
generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense.
(It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to
be to a principle of non-coercion, the only areas of public spending
that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns....hmmm...)

Perhaps you have.  May I suggest that you consider that revolutionaries
frequently generate support by acting as protectors of "geezers," 
mothers and children.  Governments that ignore such people on the grounds
that "we don't have much to fear" from them do so at their own peril.

       If you happen to know a political position which does not
have people advocating it who do more harm than good, please point it
out.

       One of the advantages and draw-backs of requiring proof
on the part of the government before they may take action against
citizens.  (and part of the reason some of us believe weapons should
be available.)

       We are not arguing the absolute sanctity of the U.S.
Constitution.  In fact, the fillibuster we're talking about isn't
*in* the Constitution.  I objected to your suggestion that the Senate
wasn't intended to exercise the power it was clearly given.

       I'll point out again that Reagan only had a Republican Majority
in the Senate during his first term, and his coalition in the House
came apart at about the same time.  Bush never had any real support in
Congress.

       The real point is that everybody, *everywhere* got their pork,
from the big corporations to the guy I saw last night leaving a
convenience store with an armful of junk-food he'd bought with
food stamps.  (He spent more in food stamps on junk than I *make* in a week
and I'm not on government assitance.)

>Money was diverted from programs addressing
>social needs and poured into the weapons industry in the form of cost
>plus profits contracts. 

       Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.

       In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billion
dollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase of
approx. 884 billion dollars.

       In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In
192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars.
That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccounted
for.  (This represented an increase of 230%)

       In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs,
Housing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare)
cost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, or
more than national defense started.  (This represented an increase
of 230%)

       In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars on
Medicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of
368%)

       In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housing
credits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.

       In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billion
dollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.

       Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.

       Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.

       Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.

       Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.

       Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.

       Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.
     
       About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under 
the Energy category, primarily under "Supply," and "Community Development,"
in the area of "disaster relief," and between the two of them
represent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.

       Where *was* this huge diversion?

>In order to rectify this situation there must
>be constitutional revision.

       Not that's a stretch.  If the current government was pushed by
the President to create this mess, wouldn't one expect it to begin to
equalize once the pressure is gone?

>Secondly the form of this revision must take account of the changed 
>circumsatnces of the role of the Federal government. 

       Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want
to continue. I see very little positive about it.

>The constitution
>cannot be used to frustrate the democratic process. 

       The Constitution was *designed* to frustrate the democratic
process, so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting
what they wanted by the time it happened.  Nor do I see putting the
brakes on the "democratic process" an inherently bad thing.  Califronia's
riding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense
it gets worse.

>If the peoplr want
>to have welfare spending by the federal government they will have
>it.

       Sometimes, or perhaps most of the time, the people should be
told, "no," and pointed to their local government.       

>Attempting to prevent this through constitutional trickery only
>leads to the constitution being brought into disrepute. 

       Phill, would you do me the very great favor of repeating that
in talk.politics.guns?

       Cute.  We can eliminate violations of the law by eliminating
the law.

>This is a major reason why the right to own

       Free speech alone is dangerous, Phill.

       OK, Phill.  All you gotta show me is a clear pattern of
*reduction* in homicide rates across several countries and that'll
be it.  (Not current, mind, you, reduction.)

        Who's chaining anything to freedom of speech?  By *calling*

       Phill, you're a master of subtly changing the subject.  I haven't
*based* my argument against raw democracy on the Constitution.  I've
tried to explain why it isn't a good idea.  The only time I've referred
to the Constitution is to point out it doesn't contain the restrictions
on the veto and the Senate you appear to believe were "meant," but
just didn't make it in there.
     
       The Constitution doesn't *contain* the 41% fillibuster rule.
I only believe that the rule is a good idea.  You cn't dismiss that
as venerating the Constitution because it isn't *in* the Constitution.

Joe,

     As usual, this issue of dysfunction, of bad values, of messed up culture 
is easily embraced by non african americans when it comes to explaining
problems in our community. From your post, you apparently find the idea that
something is wrong with African Americans, value-wise, culture wise or
something, very appealing. I never cease to be amazed at how eager non african
americans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assert
that something is wrong with us. The socio-economic factors which we know help 
to produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large 
proportion, I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, we
somehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is 
laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. But 
nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. No, that has 
socioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a 
dysfunction.

Basically, I think this tendency for non african americans to believe that
something is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want to
deal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african
americans, and that this is about 80% of the problem. It could not possible be
that the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this has
a very effective negative effect on us. No, something is wrong with us.
Non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they 
are so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good 
hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage. I would get angry if it 
werent' so damn typical.

Peace - Aaron

	Without having a complete answer to this question,  I should think
it obvious that the first step should be to convince people this would be
a desirable result.  There are still quite a lot of people who feel that
the command economies of eastern Europe failed due to corruption rather than
essential weaknesses of caommand economies,  and you still have a majority
in this nation that favors keeping unenforced and unenforcible laws on
the books in order to "send a signal".

I fail to see why you should feel this way in the first place.  Constant

they tend to get invaded before they can come to anything like a stable
society anyway.

Umm, is there any distinction between "vague" and "elastic" in this
context aside from one having a more positive connotation than the other?

At any rate,  we've been through all this before.

And the religious right worships engines, smokestacks, landfills,
and hates people.

What does this name-calling have to do with anything you are claiming about
the truth of environmental disaster?  Nothing that I have read in this
thread, nor heard from anyone I have talked to, would suggest to me that 
people fit the definition you give of the religious left.  Come off it, Phil.
A prime motivation for protecting our environment is so that we, 
people, can continue to live in it healthily.  We just disagree on what
is necessary to maintaining a healthy environment FOR PEOPLE.

What!? They have already repaired that old hulk!!!?  WOW!!! ;-)

I suppose you *mean* the Alaskan shores that were devastated by the
Valdez accident?  I haven't seen the articles.  What do they say exactly?
Has [mostly] all the ocean and shore life returned?  The sands are [mostly]
as clean as they were before?  The microbial samples are [mostly] back to 
a normal balance? The fish and fowl populations have [mostly] returned?  What?

Not a problem?  Would you move to Three Mile Island?  I would imagine 
there is some cheap property available!  

The naturally occurring catastrophic events [disasters] that destroy 
property (ie: hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes) do not usually leave 
toxic wastes that prevent people from re-building their lives there.  
The man-made disasters (oil spills, toxic dumping, radioactive waste 
dispersions) cause death and make an area unliveable far beyond the 
initial event.

Just a couple of questions for the pro-Israeli lobby out there:

1) Is Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon temporary?  For Mr.
Stein:  I am working on a proof for you that Israel is diverting
water to the Jordan River (away from Lebanese territory).

2) Is Israel's occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and Golan
temporary?  If so (for those of you who support it), why were so
many settlers moved into the territories?  If it is not temporary,
let's hear it.

       I am contending that there is no state in the Union which does
not have ample wealth, if they choose to spend it, to run a perfectly
acceptable Education system.  (I further contend that the amount of money
being spent now is more then sufficient, but is being spent badly.)

>Or vice versa if you aren't a Republican. 

       So, tell me Phill.  Were the Republicans also responsible for some
of the *huge* increases in social programs?  Or were they *only* 
responsible for what you don't like.  (I contend it is Congress which
is to blame.  Democrat and Republican alike.)

       Most of our worst areas are still better off than most of Europe.
In any case, we're talking about *education*.

       Yes, I live in once such area.  You're woefully ignorant of the
situation.

       At the same time some of Tennessee's school districts are closing
down, the Governor asked for 7.5 million dollars for bicentenntial
celebration license plats.  In almost the same breath he wanted to raise
unemployment compensation and reduce taxes which paid into it.
 
       I don't know about the rest of the country, but *our* education
problems stem directly from two problems, neither of which are a lack
of money in the state.  (BTW, Tennessee is considered a "tax heaven"
and our economy is one of the strongest in the country.  *I* see
a correlation.)  1)  What money we spend goes primarly to administration.
The average administrator makes two and a half times what the average
teacher makes, and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue.  And 2)
the Governor is making a concerted effort to create an "Education crisis"
in order to push for his pet income tax.  Some of the most idiotic
programs get funded (like State funds for new art in the county seat)
while schools are closing.  It's not a lack of funds.  It's an
unwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate.  Education
is *the* parental hot-button.  Education is *always* the first to
but cut, because it's easier to get people to pay for their children
than ugly art.

      They did it anyway.  The Continental Congress had its own set of
bylaws.  It wasn't quite a government, but a means of making decisions
had to be created.  (However low George Washington's opinion of them were.)

      Allow me again to speak heresy against the Holy Democratic Orders.
So what?  The government was built with a very non-democratic Presidency
with fairly broad powers, including the veto.

      Yes, and the Senate was intended to act as a balance to this.
Too much democracy was intentionally avoided.  It was considered a good
thing to place non-democratic blocks to impulsive action.

      So long as Congress has something to sell, people will pay for
it.  Most congressmen rake in more money than they need.

       No, if the "progressives" don't want the "reactionaries" to move
backward, they get the same benefit.  41% of the states is a *lot* of
people.  And historically laws with that sort of minority arent'
very effective, especially since it is usually geographically
concentrated.
       When wielding the Federal Big Stick I don't see why they shouldn't
have to make a better argument than, "more people than not," agree.

       Now, I've asked several times, and all you've done is answer
"It isn't democratic," which I knew before I said it.  Why *should*
it be democratic?  We don't have a true direct democracy, and few
people advocate one.  Why, then, is this other modification of
democracy to bias it against action so much worse?

>Why the hell would such an oil rich (and hydroelectric potential to be
>exploited) spend billions on a nuclear energy programme?

     For several reasons, including:

     - With the current rate of growth of population and considering the
       60 million people who are already living there, the oil reserves
       won't last for more than 30 years, and after that Iran has to have
       other sources of energy.

     - Even with unlimited resources of oil, it is the most wastefuls and
       foolish way to burn the oil just for thermal energy, while thousands 
       of valuable derivatives could be taken from oil. For example, I
       bought an iron for $11:00 here in Canada, later I bought a garbage
       bucket for our kitchen for nearly $12:00!!! The bucket has been made
       from  petroleum products, and I bet the producing country has not
       received even 5 cents for the amount of the oil used in that bucket,
       while the western producer, thank to the monopoly they have in 
       technology and are trying to maintain it in all fields of science by 
       methods you saw in that program, makes billions of dollars every
       year.

     - Iran's hydro-potential is something around 10,000 MW which won't be
       enough in less than 10 years. Even exploiting this potential takes
       billions of dollars and so many years, which can not catch up with
       the rate of growth in Iran's energy production.

     - More important than all above, the science is not the belonging of any
       specific group or nation. It is none of anybody's business if a nation
       want's to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, if that nation has
       accepted international monitoring, something which Iran has done.

      You can do whatever you want to. But fair people of the world won't

  of IAEA from Iranian sites, and their constant rejection of the idea that
  Iran has a nuclear bomb production program.

     Good sense of humor! Since you have been sleeping during past few

  Afghanistan, Tajikestan, to Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Iraq, Lebanon,
  Palestine, boreder between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, etc. to see that only
  Iran is in calm and peaceful situation. Also, look at Iran's stance with

Then why do we really need national health insurance then? Wouldn't it just make
more sense to find some way to cut down on the cost of malpractice insurance?

And maybe that's not such a good thing. I also read somewhere that it is next to
impossible in Canada to litigate against the health system-class action suits
are nearly impossible, and you can't sue the provincial health officials at all.

Oh no. Don't let the AMA know about this. They have enough power as it is. Ask

Well, yeah, tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre outside Ottawa.
Theoretically it's limited to service personnel, but some studies I've heard
about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not
only have connections but aren't "urgent" at all.

The problem is, in a system where hospitals' annual budgets are approved by the
government, how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions?
I bet that if you're an MP or MPP, or good friends with one, you're put on any
hospital's "urgent" care list no matter how minor your problem. Which is OK 
unless you're someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot.

Hmm. How much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of GNP spent

So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse. Bob Rae, the
second least popular man in Ontario, warned Ontarians a few years ago that if
they didn't stop cross-border shopping in such huge numbers, "the services they
expect from the province just won't be there in a few years" (Fortunately for
them (and less fortunately for the retailers here in Western New York) the 
Canadian dollar went back to a more realistic value). He didn't say so, but I
knew he meant the OHIP. What would happen if his warning turned out to be the 
truth? Would the private insurers take up the slack? They'd be under no 
obligation to. Of course, they could eventually make money again, but if what
you say is true, they'd be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling 
such basic services, too).

Again, I doubt Americans would like giving the insurance companies that much
power. I half wonder if the Canadian health insurers didn't go along with the
provinces and the federal government years ago because they knew that there was
a good chance of the public system going bust in the long run, and then 
afterwards they could clean up (Okay, this sort of contradicts what I said
higher up. But it's another possibility). They'd have an added bonus when 
arguing against government involvement in their industry-as they could then 
point to its failure instead of just citing theoretical principles.

Hmmm, give everyone a gun, free.  What a thought.  Let's see where it would
lead...  I have a gun, I don't like your attitude, I shoot you.  Your friends
have guns, they don't like me shooting your, they shoot me.  My friends have
guns, they don't like your friends shooting me, they shoot them. . . . Does
this sound like a good thing?  Sounds like it would set society back over a
hundred years.

Funding abortion for those women who can't afford it would save the
government money, not cost it.  The cost of delivery is much higher,
and those women can't afford that either.  Funding guns, as you suggest
as an "analogy" would *cost* the government money and would lead to
effective anarchy.  See the difference?  Somehow I doubt you can.

The speed limit on commuter tracks in the northeast is 120MPH.  We
already have something that resembles high speed rail in this
country and it requires massive government subsidies.  We don't need
another government boondoggle.

Well, the fact of the matter is that poverty is imperfectly related to 
social and political instability, while economic inequality is much more
strongly related.  In virtually all major revolutions including
England (the Puritan revolution), France, Russia and China, the 
revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term 
growth and poverty was declining.  What sets off revolutions is massive
inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom
that social change is possible.

If "poverty (were) the main engine of social instability," this typical
historical pattern would not hold.  In fact, revolutions would have been
far more typical before the nineteenth century than since that time.

Sorry, buddy, but some other "blowhards" managed to include the "general
welfare" in another portion of the constitution.

Article I Section 8: "The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect
taxes...to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and GENERAL
WELFARE of the United States..."

I guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they
said in the preamble.

But as noted above, the constitution doesn't say that, does it?

But since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense
in Article I, Section 8, I guess you'll grant that botha are constitutional
functions.  Right?

Since our doctors are private and the "system" is just an insurance
plan, litigation would not involve the insurance fund.  Our lawyers
do not work on contingency, so that if you were to sue for malpractice
then you'd better be sure of winning to cover your fees ... likewise,
if you were a doctor and subject of a suit, it's time to sweat.

A few weeks ago, the president of the Canadian MA wrote a letter to
the NYT to decry a lobbyist's advert repeating the same old trash.
This is significant because the AMA and the CMA are interlinked
organizations and he would not have done it without the approval 
of his AMA cronies.

It serves the same purpose as the Bethesda Naval Hospital ... since
not all hospitals can provide everything, maybe they have some stuff
that others don't?  (Ottawa's population is only a quarter million,

People of influence will get their way in any system, American or
European.  It's the "Golden Rule" - he who has the gold makes the
rules. (-;

As for annual budgets, those are actually annual grants for facilities
(e.g., mops, pans, etc.) given to hospitals of which most are private
nonprofit foundations (btw, I have no problem with having aggressive
for-profit hospitals like the French, who use our approach ... but in
the Paris region they have almost as many people as Canada does so
their market is much more diverse).  The rest has to be made up for
by billings from patients who use their services.

The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total
outlay, and  are compiled use the same methods by the OECD that yield 
the 13-14% figure for the U.S.

>So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse.

How?  They are collecting premiums ... and I'm an advocate of having
copayments like the French do in their system in order to make it look
more like the real insurance that it is.  The private doctors and 
hospitals will still be there after the insurance (hypothically)
disappears, as they were there before it appeared.

For one thing, I think that Bob Rae is an idiot ...

Most of OHIP comes from separate premiums on your paycheck if you are
a player ...  he wants to spend our money on other things than the
health insurance.  Our high taxes are high for other spending but
health insurance, which is separate and optional, and it is being 
spent in a nonpartisan manner by every party. )-;

OHIP is just a health insurance plan; it does not provide any kind
of health care, that is up to you and your private doctors.

Some of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries of
American companies, and their parents provide full insurance down
here.  Regardless, all firms up north can easily turn on cable TV
to see how well the American firms are doing by being involved in
basic coverage.  The private firms are making too much money after
having gotten rid of basic coverage.  They run around patting them-
selves on the back for their own cooperation in providing extras 
for those people who "deserve it".

I agree ... they were in a win-win situation.  But right now, it seems

are.  Friends from my sisters' MBA class were still being flown out
for job interviews individually with insurance firms in London, ON,
(Canada's insurance capitol a la Hartford) along with generous expense
privileges this year despite the ongoing post-recession blues.

This is a difficult problem for which there is no obviously good
solution.  One approach is simply to try and move political opinion
and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Another
approach is to try and amend the constitution.  The original
constitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention
for 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it.
The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains
government (particularly state and local), even though on many
particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I think
libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via
an amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).

Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this as
a problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That might
be true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  If
a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then
falls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This is
unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held
for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now,
but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of,
if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.

It would if malpractice and "defensive medicine" were the main
factors in explaining spiralling US health care costs, but they aren't.

Although Gary is correct in noting that malpractice-related problems are
greater in the US than Canada, they by no means account for the overall
difference in health care costs.  (They do account for a somewhat larger
portion of the difference in physicians' gross income in the two countries.)

Some facts.  Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1% of
total health care costs in the US.  In 1991, according to a survey of 
physicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averaged
paying 3.7% of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance.  
Malpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985;
they've declined significantly since then.  At the same time, health
care costs have increased more than any period in history.

As far as "defensive medicine" is concerned, the AMA estimates that its
total impact is about $7 billion per year.  That's about 8% of the total
current INCREASE in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a group
that could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine
on health care.

As small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things, however,
Clinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnification
of MD's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by their
specialties.  This would eliminate most, if not all frivolous suits
while retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice.

Exsqueeze me?  I saw *your* original post in alt.discrimination.
Your post was cross-posted to three groups.  My followup was cross-posted
to two of those three (omitting soc.motss).

Now, instead of engaging in meta-discussion off the topic, could you answer 
the question posed?  If your statement is so "beign"(!?), you should have no
trouble politely responding to a polite query.

the Lebanese government can provide guarantees that Israel will not be
attacked from Lebanese soil, and when the Syrians leave.


>2) Is Israel's occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and Golan
>temporary?

	The three are very different issues.  Israel has stated
repeatedly that it will not give up the whole Golan, but may be
willing to give part of it to Syria as part of a peace agreement.

	Israel has already annexed areas taken over in the 1967 war.
These areas are not occupied, but disputed, since there is no
legitamate governing body.  Citizenship was given to those residents
in annexed areas who wanted citizenship.

	Israel should keep control of parts of the West Bank, IMHO.
The parts that should be kept are the westernmost mountain ridge,
which contain few arab towns, and many suburbs, as well as overlooking
the city of Tel Aviv.  The Eastern mountain ridge should be
abandonded.  This is where most of the arabs live and it is less
militarily relevant.  Israel should also maintain a presence in the
Jordan valley.

>If so (for those of you who support it), why were so
>many settlers moved into the territories?  If it is not temporary,
>let's hear it.

	There are a number of reasons for people to move (they were
not moved, but chose to move) into disputed areas.  Note that since
these moves were made by free willed human beings, not "settlers," I
will address two aspects of your question, why the government would
allow &/or encourage them to move, and second why they did move.

	The government had a number of reasons for encouraging people
to move across the green line.  They included security and politics.

	The first reason was security.  A large Jewish presense makes
it difficult for terrorists to infiltrate.  A Jewish settlements also
act as fortresses in times of war.

	A second reason was political.  Creating "settlements" brought
the arabs to the negotiation table.  Had the creation of new towns and
cities gone on another several years, there would be no place left in
Israel where there was an arab majority.  There would have been no
land left that could be called arab.

	The fact that there are a hundered thousands Jews in place
changes the face of any peace settlement, and restricts what land can
be given away.

	Individuals who crossed the green line had several reasons for
doing so.  They include financial, religious, and political reasons.

	Many of the communities created were "bedroom" communities.
Suburbs.  A house 20 minutes outside of Tel Aviv cost half less if it
was on the wrong side of the green line.  People who moved there
wanted a decent home at a nice price.

	Some of the communites created were religious.  They built
their neighborhoods in areas where there were jews until the riots of
the 30's and 40's.  There are communities like this in Hebron, Gaza,
and all over.  There are also communities built near religious sites.

	The last reason people moved was to establish a political
Jewish presense outside the green line.  They built communities to
control important intersections, important hilltops, roads, and other
places.

	The point is, there are many reasons people moved over the
green line, and many reasons the government wanted them to.  Whatever
status is negotiated for disputed territories, it will not be an "all
or nothing" deal.  New boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation, not
be the results of a war.

OK Phil, you're right. So far the "evidence" suggests that Nixon was a victim
of overzealous underlings and Kennedy was a womanizing disgust-o-blob with
a dash of megalomania. After crushing the CIA and FBI who's to say Kennedy 
wouldn't have created his own version of American Friendly Fascism?

Unfortunately however, we don't have all the evidence. So far this nation's
citizens have been privy to about 12 hours of the total 4,000 hours of Nixon's
tapes. What's on the rest of those babies? Some archivists have alluded that
there is "evidence" to suggest that Nixon and his cronies, including George
Bush, were aware of the plot to murder Kennedy before he was shot in Dallas.

Ask your local D.A. what the charges are for the above crime.


And so I must ask you, Phil me putz, when all this shit finally comes out
when you and I are old men, I would appreciate the privilege of sticking a pole
up your ass and parading you down Main Street with a sign on your chest:

"I was an Apologist for the American Fascist Regime circa 1944 -- 2010"

(How's that for a lovely Brecht-ian image:-)


There, that ought to get a reaction. Unless I'm in his killfile this week...

   I am glad that you recognize that people should not engage in denial
and repression, and should acknowledge such. The United States, with
its people, have recognized that repression has taken place, with the
loss and outright abrogation of civil liberties and constitutional
protections of citizens. This recognition has taken the form of the
civil rights law (let's just discuss the federal level for now), such
as 18 USC 241 et. seq., 42 USC 1981 et. seq, et. al.
   With this recognition of repression, at times manifested in the
form of collective guilt, I want people to recognize denial. 
Though it can be said that white people numerically commit more
crimes in the United States, because white people are a majority,
it can also be said that black people commit a disproportionate
amount of crime in the United States, in their relation to their
numbers in population.
   My views are out of experiences when I was a police officer
in a large metropolitan area, and of a citizen. Unless people
account for their behavior, and for the behavior of their immediate
community, nothing will improve.

Regards, 

Neal

There are "basic services" and there are "optional services", Dennis. Call 
waiting is an optional service, but having the number "3" work on one's phone
is a basic service. Just because some nutcase doesn't happen to use the "3"
on his phone, since none of the numbers he calls has a "3" in it, doesn't mean 
that he has the right to demand that the phone company "unbundle" the charges
for the use of each phone digit; an unbundling that would be horrendously
inefficient because of all the billing & bookkeeping overhead. Similarly, 
abortion can be seen as a "basic service".

Furthermore, public funding of abortion SAVES money, as well as being, in the 
views of a substantial portion of the population, probably a clear majority, 
an ethical thing to do. If you don't like saving money on your taxes in that 
way, why don't you take the taxes you save and invest in private charities 
with programs that help reduce the NEED for abortion. If every pro-lifer did 
the same, it would create a massive economic negative feedback loop which 
would all but ELIMINATE the need for public funding of abortion. Then you 
would get your wish. And, you know what? No pro-choicer I know would stop
you carrying out that plan. They might even HELP you with it...

No, it's a sign of aristocrtic out-of-touchness with the middle
class.  You ask George Herbert Walker Bush about that.

And that's not his full name?  What, then, is it?

Steve,  you're the one who suggested that a failed government should be an 
ideal proving ground,  I never felt that way in the first place.  Quite the 
contrary,  I think a better proving ground would be someplace that already
had a governemnt that would prevent outright acts of agression,  yet had a
strong spirit of individualism and initiative.  Someplace like... Texas :-)

       Well, I don't think your query was exactly polite, but I will TRY to
give you a polite responce.  Something atypical of the net, but here it goes.

       Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr. King.  From many
of the newspaper, radio, and tv news reports I have seen, this adjective      
is commonly in front of his name.  I have NEVER seen anyone complain about
the use of this adjective when used in a benign manner.  I did not say that
Mr. King was a no good black!  I do not know Mr. King and would not make this
ascertian without some evidence to this effect.  I used it PURELY as a 
descriptive adjective in the same manner than many ( most ) news people have
used it in the past.


      The entire second trial was about race, Ted.  I don't feel compelled to
discuss Mr. King's racial background, but had Mr. King been white there would
not have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating would
not have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult call
to make.  It is possible the case, but not definately.  

      I still think your actions are crap, Ted.  They are far more divisive than
me using the adjective 'black' in a non-derogenory manner.  Would you have
been happier if I had used 'African-american' ?  If so, then you really are
lost in the world of PC.  You have already been instrumental in getting one
persons net access revoked, and I wonder if you have sent a copy of my 
message to my sys admin with a plea that I am not worthy of posting.

     The way you went about this 'polite' inquiry makes me believe it was 
anything but.

Okay,  let me try to explain this.

When one votes for such a creature as a Senator or,  worse yet,  a President,
one votes not for specific policies but for a general package which must cover
all issues for 4 or 6 years.  As such,  one's influence is highly diluted.
I might add that,  even if one were free to vote on individual regulations,
the vast amount of time required for considering a particular regulation,
combined with the very small chance of one's vote making a difference,  would
make it unreasonable to expect the voter to make an intelligent decision
with respect to specific regulations.

I'm not sure what you mean by "feasible" in this case.  Do you mean that

:Actually, the only areas of public spending above that strike me as 
:generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense.

2 of the four you saw fit to  mention,  and education of minors is always
another possibility,  since minors are generally considered not to be
responsible to make their own decisions as adults are.

:(It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to
:be to a principle of non-coercion, the only areas of public spending
:that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns....hmmm...)

You say this as if it were surprising,  yet in fact a necessary consequence
of libertarian philosophy.  All non-coersive functions should be dealt 
with privately,  therefore it follows that the only functions remaining to
the state are the coersive ones.

Much more likely it's drunken teenagers.  The groups in questionare more 
likely

event that you missed my earlier sarcasm,  let me say this directly:
The idea that such programs as Social Security or AFDC should be considered
"defense" (an idea which has been advanced in ths and other newsgroups) is
so absurd a lie as to be unworthy of consideration.  Do you seriously
dispute this?


	I don't want to seem patronizing,  but you still seem to be laboring
under the delusion that under a socialized economic system it is reasonably
intelligent and honest persons (like yourself) who make the decisions.

I did hear this question asked during a radio news update of the case.  (They
were talking about the ongoing trial and had some audio clips).  Immediately
after the defense attorney asked the question, there was an "Objection!" heard
in the background.  The clip ended at that point so I don't know if the
objection was upheld.  I can't imagine NC is *that* bad.

This I didn't hear as an audio clip but heard it reported a number of times on
news stories both during and after the trial.  Now the "we did it on purpose"
thing is stretching, I think it was something more like--he had it coming.  If
somebody else remebers better than I on this second point, feel free to
clarify.

Didn't the new study asked "have you engaged in homosexual intercourse
within the last two years" whereas Kinsey asked "have you ever engaged

Yes, thank you, though I am really curious as to why this never came out
(at least not in what I saw, up here in Canada, or on CNN, which is sent
up here) during the Thomas nomination hearings.  Surely, one would think
that her claim to having been sexually harassed, would have a great deal
less credibility if it could be shown that she had herself been guilty of it.

Ahemmm....  It depends.  :-)

(For instance, if it were the "sworn statements" at the Warren Commission,
then yes, I _would_ say that the statements were no better than toilet
paper, used at that :-), but in most cases, the answer would be "no").

I'm afraid that I've lost the thread here.  I didn't suggest that all 
government regulations be subject to referenda.  So I don't follow the 
comments above.

I mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally
undesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw
support among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate.

Furthermore, I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an
industrial society because the weight of litigation and/or misery it
would produce would effectively crush productive effort.

No, I'm not surprised.  I just think it's interesting that on one hand
libertarians assume a limited government can be decreed, yet on the other
posit an entire government made up of people who carry guns.  (I realize
that many libertarians assume that such a government will be 
counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry, but it is worth noting that
widespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the
establishment of totalitarian government, e.g. Iraq.)

Yup, sure do.  But since I also support the constitutional requirement

I'm willing to justify such programs on that basis.

Well, in the first place, I don't support a "socialized economic system."
I think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea.  But it is not
the case that "any third party...is...as likely to be ignorant or corrupt
as the buyer or seller."  There are multitudes of examples where such a
statement is demonstrably false.  Regulation of stock market transactions
that provide a reasonable basis for buyers to avoid fraud is only one
example.

Wait a minute.  I agree with you that people have to take responsibility
for their own behavior (I assume that's what you meant by the word
"account"), but also for "the behavior of their immediate community"?

First of all, how "immediate" are you talking about, and secondly, I
have a lot of trouble with any theory of social behavior or justice
which charges anyone with the duty of taking responsibility for or
accounting for the actions of a different person...

   Geez, where have you been, Ryan?  I proposed this theory *months*
ago.  Let's take it one step further, even.  If, as the surveys show,
up to 33% of all men have *had* a homosexual encounter, then there must
be an even *larger* percentage of people who have had homosexual erotic
fantasies.  But if less than 10% of the population is gay, what can we
say about these people who don't identify as gay but have demonstrated
gay potential.  Obviously, a large chunk of these people *chose* (or,
more accurately, were forced to choose by force of religion and social
sanction) to put those feelings aside, to be heterosexual.

   Obviously, Cramer and Kaldis fall into this category.

   These people are the ones who are so hung up on "choice."
Obviously, since *they chose*, everyone must have, and homosexuals are
just flaunting their "perversion" by choosing not to go along with what
society has dictated.

   Of course, I'm that most awful of perverts.  I chose, I gleefully
admit that I was heterosexual until I met the right man and *chose* to
indulge in my homoerotic potential.  Take that!

      Elf !!!

William: If the reason that this country still stands after 200+ years
is that it uses military conscription to force young men to fight for
causes that they don't believe in strongly enough to volunteer for
military service in support of, then perhaps the fact that the country
is still standing is not good news...

     What kind of brainless clod doesn't understand the difference 
     between a "PROPOSED BILL, BLOCKED IN CONGRESS" and an "EXECUTIVE
     ORDER, ISSUED BY CLINTON, AND CRAMMED DOWN OUR THROATS".

     
  Here, let me give a remedial course in thinking:

     In order to create the appearance of low interest rates, Uncle Sam
     has shifted his debt from long-term to short-term securities.

     In effect, Uncle Sam has transformed the Federal Goverment into
     one giant S&L, waiting to blow.

     Short-term rates rise --->  Interest payments on Deficit rise --->
     Uncle Sammy has to borrow more ---->  Causing Short-term rates to rise.

     Uncle Sammy gets caught in a positive feedback loop.  His options:

       i) Raise taxes a truly unimaginable amount
       ii)  Make truly unimaginable spending cuts

    Results of i):  large numbers of pissed-off citizens
    Results of ii): large numbers of pissed-off citizens


    Uncle Sammy has thoughtfully taken the initiative to pre-empt the use
    of communication newtworks to foster a nation-wide, grassroots
    uprising.

No one is questioning whether Mr. King is black.  The question arises
whether King's race should make police officers "afraid as hell."  Your
statement seems to imply that cops should have a different standard for
large black guys than for just large guys in general.  

That two posts later you don't understand why anyone pointed out your use
of the adjective is almost as informative as your original use.

They don't work because you need a nation-wide confiscation of all guns,
Ralphie. That's why it dosen't work in D.C. They didn't confiscate the guns
that all ready exist. Therefore what Ray said still applies.

However Ralphie, the amount of killings would go down. Think about it. With
guns it just takes the pull of a trigger. Other forms of murder require much
more effort on the part of the murderer.

You should! Although maybe you're right. Well armed citizens wouldn't have
to worry about little boys and their threats against women and abortion
clinics.

Ralphie, ever been to London or any major city in the UK? You know not what
you speak. And as far as England being in dire straits, have you forgotten
your lines about civil wars and society erupting in the U.S.

Ralphie, only you in your sick mind would think that this is the reason Japan
and Germany's GNP are two of the highest. Probably had more to do with the
economic re-building after World War II. I think you need to study the issue
a little more. But in Ralphie's World, violence is to be worshipped. Isn't it
Ralphie (or whichever of your multiple personalities wrote this post)?

Komrade EMIL,

How many times need we point the obvious OUT to you.
As LONG as the Patriarchy has been Decimated by 
ModernSeXularHumanism and ITS imposition that only
the STATE is authorized to Wield Capital Punishment,
We can NEVER restore WholeSomeGodFearingBibleBelievingTraditionalFamilyValues!

Now Just Imagine Father Abraham in the Modern Era?

God Comes unto him and demands that he take his son up
to the Hills to be sacrificed unto the Lord.

Now Abraham being a devout man leads out his son for a 
sacrifice to God On High, and BANG!!!! Out Comes the BATF
with Tanks and Air Support to cover the Child Protection Agency
with a Warrent for Abraham's arrest as a Moral Deviant and a 
Child Abuser!!!! The BATF Lays SIEGE to Father Abraham's home
for months on END and will NOT LISTEN to the VOICE of GOD!!!!

As LONG as ModernSeXularHumanism is allowed to DENY the
God Given Rights of the Patriarchy we CAN NOT be SAFE!!!!!


ciao

       That's the really cute thing about saying the 2nd amendment

     I am so tired about all this debate on how many gays there
are!  Such arguments are basically worthless, imho.  Would it 
really matter if it were millions of people who are regularly
denied access to housing, employment, and personal security or
even only one?  
    As for death threats, I happen to know from personal
experience that gay people are far more likely to receive
them based on political veiws or even personal philosophies
related to the issue of sexual orientation than are heterosex
uals. Not a week goes by that I personally or one of my friends
is not physically or verbally harrassed for even appearing to
be gay.  
     Everyone is garaunteed certain unalienable rights under
our current form of government in theory, yet every day 
gay people are victimized by their local governments, by
the police force, and by (for the most part) an uninformed
and ignorant public. Is this democracy? I don't think so.
   A society's sense of justice is judged on the basis of
the treatment of the people who make up that society.
All of those people. And yes, that includes gays, lesbians,
and bisexuals whose "crimes" have no victims, and who
are as varied and diverse as the society of wich they are
a part.

You said it worked so well with tobacco.  I was being fascisious(I can't spell

Look, this is getting ridiculous, first, I think tobacco should be legal.  
Anybody who can't see the difference between tobacco and marijuana has got to 
be high.

I have to agree with you... the police may have carried it a bit too far
but Rodney King was no angel either. And I don't think ANY guilty
verdicts should have been returned. I'm sure you know why they handed
down guilty verdicts on two of the officers. It's quite simple really,
it was a compromise to avoid rioting in the places where minorities
think it's right to riot. I hate to say this, but I would have liked to
see them riot with everyone prepared. It would be open season if your
skin was even slightly brown.

Hey, my motto is, you don't fuck with me or my stuff and you don't get
killed. It's just that simple.

I'm all in favor of drug legalization, but I do see some problems with
it. My hope is that people disposed to doing so would simply overdose
quickly, and be done with it, before making a mess of thisgs.

Israel has made it quite clear that it has absolutely no desire to
keep any Lebanese territory, and will leave completely after a peace
treaty is signed and Lebanon gains control of its own country from
Syria and controls the terrorists launching strikes against Israel
from Lebanon.

Considering this, it obviously would be pointless for Israel to be
working on diverting water away from Lebanese territory.

Who gets to keep what parts of Judea and Samaria will be determined in
a peace settlement.  Obviously, Israel will keep some, and the Arabs
will get some.

Israel has tried to get out of Gaza almost from the time it got stuck
with it.  It has been refused by the Arabs several times.  Although
there are some Israelis who are extremely reluctant to give it up, I
seriously doubt Israel will keep more than a tiny portion of it in any
settlement.

The Golan Heights is a serious security problem, and Israel obviously
will have to keep part of it and give up part of it.  (One should
remember that the Golan Heights had been part of the area that was to
be in Britain's Palestine Mandate, slated to become part of the Jewish
state, until Britain traded it to France for other considerations.  In
other words, it is an historical accident that it was ever part of
Syria.)

    Non-toxic tear gas?!?  Do you know what tear gas is?

    I do: once upon a time I happened to be in a room when someone threw 
    a tear-gas grenade in (that was supposed to be a joke:).  The sensation 
    was incredible: I felt my eyes and nostrils were being torn apart.
    I remember us - a bunch of young men in our early 20's - running out
    like a herd of wild animals, knocking down the door and jumping
    out of the windows (thank G-d we were on the first floor).

    I can't imagine this kind of stuff being used against children.

Utopia is a myth (although we can do a lot better than what we have today).

(ie You can do better under our style of system).

I'm flattered by your invitation, but I'm afraid you have the wrong person.
Although I completely agree with your civil liberties agenda, I'm not 
in support of your economic agenda. What I DO like about the Libertarian
party is that you guys are so good at shaking up the tired ideas of the
past. I encourage you guys to continue your crusade, but I'm afraid I

I don't necessarily agree with Pat Robertson.  Every one will be placed before
the judgement seat eventually and judged on what we have done or failed to do
on this earth.  God allows people to choose who and what they want to worship.
Worship of money is one of the greatest religions in this country.

Cult status, maybe, but they didn't have to take up arms to protect themselves.
As you may recall, the early Christians were pacifists preferring to avoid
physical confrontation rather than dealing with it in like manner.  Why else
do you think the apostles were thrown into jail so often and beaten up for the
sake of their beliefs?

Self-fulfilled.  I heard that Koresh was predicting that the FBI would be the
ones to burn.  It doesn't take any great insight to light yourself on fire, maybe
perverse delusion.

NOT!  He was an egomaniac who had the attention of the entire world for a brief
moment in time.  Rather than live with the shame of being taken captive by the
FBI, Koresh chose to kill himself and his followers.  Sick and . . . sad.

  I don't think it's too far off of the mark, either.  No one 'deserves' what
they get.  Punishment is for the justice system (flawed as it may be).  This
whole 'well it served the idiots right' mentality is nothing but a revenge
mentality, and my opinion is that "revenge is for children and the emotionally
retarded" (Frank Herbert, 'Dune' series).

  Well... every group has a somewhat selective memory of it's past.  Even the
protestants who look to Martin Luther for starting the whole movement
conveniently forget his diatribes telling nobles to slaughter the peasants
who rebelled against unjust conditions.

  They stood up for what they believed in, and the people of the time hated
them for that, and because they were different.  Xenophobia has always been
one of the strongest reasons for death and destruction.

  Anyone who's confident in what they believe should not have a problem
listening to dissenting points of view...  It's something called 'free speech',
which radicals usually push aside in favour of doing what's 'right'.

 Ahh... I agree with that most strongly.  Who cares about 'claims'??  All I
want to see are actions.  If you act like you hate me, you probably do, all
pie-in-the-sky religious affiliations to the contrary.

>Lest anyone believe I do not believe in government: I do, but NOT without

  Yes!  Most people don't realize that it's NOT some 'government' sitting
in a far-away magical land that makes decisions, it's people.  And those
people make mistakes like any human.  Questioning the government in everything
it says and does should be one of our most fundamental rights.

  Until this all settles, I'm not sure anyone can make that sort of blanket
statement.  Sure, they may have been quiet peace-loving people who just
happened to be armed to the teeth, but who knows what David Koresh had planned?

  You don't even have to break laws to get punished, as I'm sure many people
have found out.  What about the drug laws that permit the police to seize
any suspect goods?  And some grandmother travels with $30,000 in cash in her
handbag, (doesn't trust the banks), it falls open, and the police end up
confiscating it?  This is not an isolated case, either.

  Or laws to stop companies from making look-alike Ford/GM car parts, and
selling them as the real thing?  The first people that got raided were antique
companies who made 'real GM' parts for 1930's cars.

  All I'm saying is that it should NOT be assumed that someone is inherently
evil/etc when the government decides to nail them.

  It's the people who blindy believe that the government does the best in
everything for them who are _really_ dangerous.

In addition, it is ridiculous for this Hicks guy from the FBI saying that
they were just trying to bring them before the bar to face justice, when
who should really be on trial is every officer involved in the brainless
BATF assault.  Granted, it would be tough to convict when the bodies were
inside, but if you're going to talk about justice then you have to consider
the gross incompetence and disregard for human life displayed by the ATF.
Charge 'em and try 'em!

It is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by
"average" people, and that at the time, almost all Americans were pretty
homogeonously Christian.  It was largely the mainstream Christian's disgust
at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred.

The situation is not entirely different today.  Many irrational feelings and
beliefs are justified through religion.  I don't think most of them are started
because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and perpetuate
prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification which discourages
critical thought.

Do you mean that the "secular authorities" are some continuous group of
people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the
Mormons?  Do you honestly believe that the main reason for using Utah for
nuclear testing etc.. was to "get them thar Mormons"?  And what about the
majority of Uthan's who aren't Mormons?  You seem to be searching for enemy
conspiracies.  It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you badly
must have been done primarily for that purpose.

I personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to the
life of even one person.  Sure, he did not pose a threat to the security of
this nation.  But he did pose a threat to the lives of his followers.  That
much is definite.

This is like asking who REALLY caused the deaths of the Israeli Olympic
team in 1976?  In that case, the police botched the job as well.  But to
lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorists would be a terrible mistake.
I think the same sort of reasoning applies in this case.  Certainly, if David
Koresh chose any peaceful option, the ATF and FBI would have complied.  The
responsibility is more his than the authorities.

>David Koresh, no doubt, will be described as the "evil" guy (by the

Characterizing the ATF/FBI as executioners is inaccurate and unfair.  In order
to be an executioner, the least one must have done is have the intent to kill.

The mother church of Jerusalem disappeared when the Romans took the city.
Despite some pious legends, the evidence seems to be that the members of
the church died fighting the Romans during what they believed to be the
last days. We know that certain Apostles had nicknames connecting them to
Jewish terrorist groups. For the average inhabitant of the Roman Empire
(especially after centuries of political instability and terror), the
Roman policies in Palestine were heartily approved of. When studied with a
knowledge of cult psychology, Acts is eerily familiar, especially today.

My opinion is this:  In a society whose economy is primarily based on 
capitalism, the role of government should be to provide those goods and 
services that need providing for the general public's good.  BUT government 
should supply those necessary goods and services only when it is impossible 
for a private enterprise (or individual) to make money from providing them.
I agree with some of the other posts that this train probably can not make 
money and will rely heavily on State tax dollars.  

The question, I think, then becomes:  Do we, the general public, need the train?

I certainly do not, nor will I ever, need this train in Lubbock, Texas.  With
the inexpensive air travel provided between Dallas and Houston, I don't think
people in Dallas or Houston need it either.

Either the government has force available to it, or it doesn't.  The
Libertarian position is that the government can use force only when someone
else uses force first -- even when that first force is not directed
against the government, but one of its citizens.  That all being true, 
what safeguards do we have against the government CLAIMING that some
initiation of force on its part is really a response?  (Like the burning
of the Maine, the Tonkin Gulf incident, or the assault on Waco?)

I ask this not to argue, but to understand.

	Hmmm...let's see here - the drugs in question are illegal,
kids shooting kids (actually people shooting people) is illegal, 
sex with children is illegal, child abuse is illegal, etcetera etcetera.

It is always cheaper to kill children than to take responsibility for
them.  Why stop at birth, why not fund infanticide up to age 2?

But remember that had God extinguished the blasphemous trash of Europe (and

Fine.  Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable
with the use of state sponsored coercion.  The notion that coercion can
be virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is
eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious 
consideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.  

For example, does "non-initiated force" (coercion) include tax collection?
Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned
by Adam Smith?  Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the
state, how is the state to deal with it?  Exclusively through after the
fact arbitration/legal compulsion?

Well, I must admit that the picture of libertarians as Amway participants
is somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a 
complex, conflictual, industrial society.  I'd venture to point out, 
however, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group 
of "seminar participants" to "embrace" their philosophy, their 
propaganda skills need to be honed.  

Frankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a 
society in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper
government policy.  Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalities
can be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  And as Mr. Marx said,
the state will just wither away.  

On the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating 
virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the 
current society will help us to live happier lives? Or is it like
socialism; just some short-term pain that we'll have to bear until 
everyone has had the benefit of "re-education" through regular 
"seminar" training?

Your comment here is meant as a put down. It fails for several reasons :

1) You have edited out the context of the action under discussion. 
2) I never brought the legal definition up. I use the English language
and not the legal dialect. The legal definition of fraud changes from
one country to another in any case. The context of the discussion is morality
of censorship.

You are extrapolating from the statement I made concerning a circumstance
in which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the Teel case.
If you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you
thought me you would have done rather better. The mode of argument I was using
was a form of rhetoric. Argument by example, I describe a wide set of
circumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they
do not apply, thus the action is not permisable.

Obviously a company posting from a University adress would be squashed,  it
would be contrary to the internet comercial use.

Now you are clutching at straws. In the context of the discussion it was
the fact of association between the company and the post that was important.
The typeface etc is inconsequential.

Certainly I oppose the right of Dr Sidiqui and the Ayatolah Khomenhi to
call for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Incitement to murder is not part
of what I consider legitimate freedom of speech.

That is irrelevant, the case is not the incremental cost but the facility
cost. If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe
to USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the company. It is
quite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and
regulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy. For example
if a Microsoft employee were to post "Windows NT is crap don't buy it"
from a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to
sack that employee. In the same way if a company decides that it has 
political objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political
manner. This is no worse than Rupert Murdoch using his papers as a political
platform for his views.

Your article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment, your signature

Are you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments
on the substantive case?

The initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable
judgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be
harmed would be grounds for prior restraint. The second set of hearings on the
substance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets
act could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already.
The part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate.

Here again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that
information is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated
to third parties. The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this
case as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves. 

The crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law.
The censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government's
ludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book.

Funny I saw that as a rejection of an assertion that you had made. Of course in
rejecting an assertion I have to make a contrary assertion, since this assertion
is unprovable I left it at that. 

So far I have not seen you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to your
own. You are attacking my anti-censorship view because I dare to accept the
validity of some pro-censorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions. 
Plus I am not an absolutist. I have this funny idea that the solution to this
problem was not decided in 1789 by a group of white male gentry in secret
session and sumarized in a single line. Furthermore I don't think that the
issues are half as simple as you imply.

    In case you haven't noticed, Clintonites are pushing a universal health
    care ACCESS program.  "Access" here means that folks who do not give 
    a damn about immunizing their children will have health care services
    delivered to their doorsteps.

On the other hand, it would be kind of scary if there were *never* a final
verdict, because a party to litigation could keep saying "Oops!  I forgot
to bring up this evidence," and demand a new trial.  You get one bite at
the apple.

It's up to General Motors to find those witnesses in the first litigation.
You'd be up in arms if a plaintiff suing General Motors pulled the same
stunt and made them relitigate an issue that they already lost.  It's not
as if General Motors couldn't file enough discovery motions to delay the
trial until they found all the witnesses they wanted.

Define "obvious bias."

Did GM move for a new trial on those grounds?  No?  Perhaps they had a 
reason?

       I've read about more than a few of these programs that ran into
problems in convincing parents to get their children immunized even
when they were delivered to their doorstep.  (I don't know, maybe
that sheet they have to be informed of about possible risks, side-

Etc, unfortunately you can't pin this on the left or the right, both are
to blame. Both sides are equally deep into the corruption scandal. The only

Ed should take a look at the budget deficit Regan and Bush created together
before he starts to make claims about europe collapsing based on the budget
deficits here. None of them are serious on the USA scale.

And here in Europe we have zero interest in Ed-Ipser type freed thank you.
We do not want our countries to be run by a narrow elite of rich lawyers
for the benefit of the super wealthy. We are quite happy with social 
democracy and despite the fuss made in Time and Newsweek there is remarkably
little being done to reverse the social welfare reforms brought in by
socialism.

The problem with socialism is that it started with the aims of free education
and health care and provision of the welfare state. This has been achieved
across the whole of Europe, only the USA is struggling to catch up. The
problem for socialism is what to do now it has succeeded.

Rather the opposite. What is happening in Italy is that the communist party
has collapsed. This has meant that the grand coalition between right and
left wing parties to keep out the communists has also collapsed. The 
magistrates have seized this opportunity to crack down hard on fraud and 
corruption and have arrested half the politicians. The fact that the socialists
are in charge this week is incidental, the right is into the corruption just
as baddly.

What looks likely to happen is the fringe parties are going to do much
better in the next election. Most of the parliamentary deputies are going
to get replaced and the parties are going to be forced to look to people
who are free of any hint of corruption. Look out for a parliament of
Pavarotti's and porn stars.

The cads! The fact that this is precisely what the US was up to of
course is not mentioned. It is a fact that Regan and Bush sold arms
to Iran, it is also a fact that they supported and armed Iraq.

Still this is state dept propaganda so none too surprizing.

In the case of Lybia there is the problem that the US only decided
that Gadffii ordered the bombing after it needed to make peace with
damascus during the gulf war. One day the US is certain that its Syria,
the next Lybia. For a strange reason the US will not provide evidence to
Lybian courts for extradition proceedings. Faced with similar demands the
USA would reject them as would any other country.

The word is "terrorism".


The problem is that after the behaviour of George Bush the USA has an
image abroad as doing precisely what it likes and is in its own interests
then comming out with a Dysney scripted sugary justification repeating a
fitting combination of the words "freedom" "dignity" "democaracy" or
of "terrorism" "dictatorship" etc as appropriate.

The USA could go quite far to mend the bridges with  Iran. The people there are
rather pissed off because the USA first supported the Shah who they
loathed and then supported Saddam when he mounted an unprovoked attack. 
Hardly surprizing after the embassy hostage crisis but Iran is meant to be
the country run by unreasonable bigots not the USA so if there is to be
movement it would be easier for the USA to move.

First off they could recognise Iraqu's responsibility in initiating the
Iran/Iraq war. Providing technical assistance to Iran to get it's oil
production back up to capacity would also be a smart move, at the moment 
Iran is above it's OPEC ceiling. If they had extra capacity they would
use it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests.

The Iranian clerics would have an interest in seeking a raprochment 
simply because a permanent war footing is debilitating. They also need
western technology.

Overriding any concern about morality is the fact that men (Dennis
is a man's name?) don't get abortions.  Thus it is unreasonable to 
suppose that YOUR insurance premiums are being used for the 
possibility that you will be getting an abortion.

It looks like what you're really objecting to is other people paying
money for the possibility that THEY might need to get an abortion.

Well you know that you're getting somewhere, when you start getting
responses like this.

Kent, let me explain it to you.

If you are paying for a phone, and you don't want call-waiting, YOU DON'T
NEED TO PAY FOR CALl-WAITING.

This whole Clinton induced abortion debate SHOULD begin to make NARAL
nervous, because it has exposed a real scam.

If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT
"abortion coverage" there is NO reason for that person to be COMPLELLED
to pay for it.  (Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction
coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage).

A full third of the country flatly considers abortion to be murder
for reasons of conscience.  If the first amendment means ANYTHING at all
anymore, then these people should NOT be COMPELLED to PAY for "abortion
coverage" if it is so OBVIOUSLY offensive to their beliefs.  Or are we
going to start forcing Jews to eat pork, Quakers to fight in wars, etc?

No one should be COMPELLED to sign a defacto "loyalty oath" in support of
abortion in order to gain access to health care, ESPECIALLY if one's
conscience is so obviously against the practice (of abortion).

Garrett, you are a really pathetic liar.

Some of your charges are arguable, but most of them are obvious lies.

I challenge you to present us with any evidence that Nixon stole,
rigged a national election, never mind elections, or used the powers
of his office for personal gain.

You can't because there is absolutely no evidence that any of these
events occurred.

of Red China.

Candidate Clinton promised to tax the rich, and most folks thought that
was a pretty nifty idea.  Then President Clinton said he wanted families
who make more than $100,000 to bear 70% of the new tax burden, and many
were quick to complain that their six-figure income does not make them one
of the well-to-do.  It's particularly ironic (to me) that it's in those
traditionally liberal enclaves of the Bay Area and academia where the
wealthy are struggling so to fit themselves into the mantle of "just
regular working-class folk".

Nobody will ever admit to being rich; everybody's middle class.  So who
are The Rich?  Well, I'll throw out some stats from the 1990 Census and
let you be the judge...

Bay Area average household income is in the mid-$40,000 range.  National

A 1,500-square-foot tract house in a Bay Area working-class neighborhood
goes for about $250,000.  I doubt that the Los Angeles market is all that
different.  It would appear that this definition of "modest" is perhaps a
bit immoderate...

} 
} >In California, $65,000 is not upper-middle-class.

} It depends upon your definition; it's clearly above average.

It is more than what two-thirds of California households make.  Seems
to me that belonging to the upper one-third is not an unreasonable
definition of "upper-middle-class".  Note that if that professor's
spouse earns $35,000 they become one of Clinton's "rich" families.

Here's a breakdown of national, California, and Bay Area household incomes:

   <$30K  $30-50K   $50-100K  $100K+
------------------------------------
US  49%     24%        23%      4% * the Census Bureau did some weird
CA  41%     26%        26%      7%   rounding here...more like 5%
BA  34%     25%        31%      9%

And to add a little prespective:

A minimum wage earner working 40 hours/week makes $8,840/year.  The poverty
line for a family of four is $15,171.  If they make up to twice that, the
government considers them to be "working poor".  Say we decide to call this
the "lower-middle-class".  Then how 'bout:

$30-50K annual income is "middle-class".  $50-100K is "upper-middle-class".
$100K+ is "rich".  $1,000K+ is "filthy-rich".  and $10,000+ is "Bill Gates".

make sense? ;^)

It is also widely stated (in non-mainstream sources) that the CIA had a
large part in the overthrow of the popular (and popularly-elected)
left-leaning Premier Mossadegh in 1953.  Is this widely recognized outside
the U.S.?  (I have never seen it mentioned at all in mainstream U.S.
media.)  How about within Iran?

Hum, I guess this has some significance as opposed to having an incredible
drop during the last days in office. Unfortuantely having a loss in the
polls during the last days of office usually means no re-election. Ask
George.

If that's true, then it's a reasonable assumption that a person named
"Dennis" will *never* need an abortion, and therefore you're already
not paying for it, so what's your problem?

I think Scalia's point was that you get one chance.  If new information
comes out later, tough.  If the conviced want justice, they have to hope
the governor is feeling charitable.

There's a guy on death row in Texas that was denied a new trial, dispite
evidence of his inocents.

not doing anybody any harm except himself.  The WOD, on the other hand, is an

1.  After birth, there are alternatives if the woman can't take

2.  Killing children is illegal.

Well here we have the right hoping for more selfish bastards. Pity they
don't look at what 12 years of the Regan/Bush "selfish Bastard" ecconomy
has done to the country.

Elect a selfish bastard government and they will run the country for themselves,
thats why they are selfish bastards. Bush and Regan gave tax breaks for the
ultra rich and paid for them by borrowing against the incomes of the middle
class.

you want your insurance premiums reduced because you won't be

Well yes and no. The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore
difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them. They
certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this
was not necessarily their true position.

The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question.
The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914
and David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has
considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.

The system is meant to be slow to react, the problem is that it ended up
a bit too slow.

The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate. Until Bush abused it
in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent
of being a check on unreasonable legislation. The veto was clearly regarded 
as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to
preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive.

the Senate is not meant to be exactly a rubber stamp body, it is meant as
a check on unrestrained legislation. That is the extra measure built into
the constitution in favour of the status quo, 60% of the representatives
of the states is not a reasonable restriction.

Maddison and Hamilton were both studying existing forms of government for
several years before they wrote the federalist papers. That the US system
is based to a considerable degree on the UK model is pretty widely accepted.
At the time there was no other major country with a representative body.
The French plebicite had been suppressed for 140 years and its restoration
eight years later would mark the start of the French revolution. 

After the UK system the major influences were the Dutch system and of course
the classical systems. Nobody seriously suggests that Rome or Greece were 
models though because the political systems of both countries were acknowleged
disasters. The main lesson learnt from Greece was that unless a federal
state was constructed a war would be inevitable. The Greek democracies were
always fighting amongst themselves which is how Rome managed to invade. Had
the federal consitution been rejected the new Roman empire in the shape of
Britain would quite certainly have reabsorbed much of the colonies in due
course. Moreover the states would have been at each others throats as soon
as the Louisiana purchase situation arose during the Napoleonic period.

How can a witness tell that someone in a burning truck is dead rather than

What kind of witnesses?  If we are talking about witnesses who were at
the accident, or were otherwise directly involved (e.g., paramedics,
emergency room doctors, etc.), then they should have been used at the
first trial.  You don't get a new trial because you screwed up and
forgot to call all of your witnesses.

If we are talking about new expert witnesses who will offer new
interpretations of the data, note that the loser can *ALWAYS* find
such witnesses.  If this were grounds for a new trial, then the loser
could *ALWAYS* get a new trial, and keep doing so until the loser
becomes a winner (and then the other side would come up with new
expert witnesses).

Not that I think anyone cares, but this pattern (using other examples
of course) was discussed 2,000 years ago by Aristotle in
_Nicomachean_Ethics_.   Note that you can't use this insight to reason
backwards; e.g.:  Since the conservatives see the media as liberal and
the liberals see the media as conservative, the media are fair!  (though
I've seen this "reasoning" implied)

Let's not forget that Yoni Netanyahu died while freeing civilian
hostages from PLO terrorists who had hijacked a passenger airliner to
Uganda.  Mrs. Dora Bloch apparently died in Uganda though I don't
believe that her body has ever been found.  This is the very same PLO
that both Rabin and Netanyahu refuse to negotiate with.  This should
not be surprising.

WOW !!!!
Did I discover a great BBS !!
It's called Sovereignty Lies In The People
BBS: 916-589-4620  14.4 k baud.  FREE and Confidential
! Fictitious names OK !  Subjects and files contained on the BBS:

* FIND OUT HOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SCAMMING US !!!!
* State Citizenship documents and issues.
  ARE YOU A CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC CITIZEN OR A U.S. FEDERAL CITIZEN ?
  Remember there were only State Citizens before the 14th amendment!!
  One is subject to federal income tax, one isn't.
  Did you volunteer to surrender your State Citizenship when you got
  your Social Security number?  Which one are you?
* Tax laws and issues.  BEAT THE IRS
* Traffic laws and issues.  BEAT TRAFFIC TICKETS.  Can you answer this one:
  What law allows a police officer to arrest you without a warrant when
  he issues you a ticket?
* Religious truth issues.  ARE ALL RELIGIONS SCAMS ????
  ARE ALL CHRISTIAN  RELIGIONS OF THE GREAT CREATOR GOD ????
* Trust documents and issues.

The SYSOP told me that instructions to beat traffic
tickets will be on the BBS shortly.  Beat traffic
tickets without going to court!!!  The BBS is GREAT, spread the word !!!!
Also:  How come I don't hear more people talking about the
Federal Reserve Bank?  Just ask yourself these questions:

1) Why would anyone borrow money from themselves at interest?
The Federal government does * NOT * * NOT *
The Federal reserve Bank is private.  The American people are
being ripped off royally.  100% of the income tax goes to pay
on the Federal debt to the Federal Reserve Bankers.  Not one
dime goes for services.  Services like the military and
welfare come from excise taxes and the like.

2) Why do we the American people stand for this?????

       There are a couple of ways to look at them.  One is, "We want
you to support this Constitution, so we'll say anything that we think
will appeal to you," or the more straightforward, "This is why we think
what we've suggested in this Constitution is a good idea."

       You clearly consider the former to be the primary situation.

       Well, I know Hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist, and 
probably the authoritarian extreme to Jefferson's democratic impules.
But what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions
on the government if we don't consider what they wrote about the
government?

       And is writing in support of something automatically "propoganda"
to the point we must assume it is untrue or that they are saying what
they don't believe?

       If the Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords, than
we'd almost have to state that the House of Representatives was also.
(In fact, they both were, because the British government had much
greater power than did the American system).

       I disagree.  The system is not too slow, it was simply designed to
handle less than it has demanded that it handle.  As somebody in Washington
put it (whose name I forget), "Congress has become everybody's city
council."

       Congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than
enough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its
original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy.

       It is not a case of the system of government they created failing,
but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically
wanted to avoid.  Namely, a concentration of power.  It would seem
then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either
House in some attempt to grease the wheels.  All you'll get then is
a system which moves quicker to do stupid things.  It would make more
sense to make more decisions at a local level.

       I fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were
placed on the veto.  It could just as easily have been read as a means
to put a check on democratically popular but unwise (in the executive's
opinion) policies.  

       There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto power
regarding what a bill is for.  Previous Presidents have used the veto
for any number of reasons, most usually having something to do with their
agenda.  I am really curious how you single Bush out as *the* President
who abused vetos.

       Why is it not a reasonable restriction?  Because 51 Senators
is the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based?  If 41 Senators
feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and 
fillibuster isn't that *enough* to indicate there's a sufficient question
as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re-evaluate it?

       Why one earth *should* 51% be sufficient to enact a law which
covers 250 million people in very, very diverse places and living
in radically different conditions?  Why *shouldn't* a super-majority
be required?

       Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power
to ignore the minority then the minority *will* be ignored.  I do not
see this as a positive thing.  And for all that I'm sure the Republicans
are looking for pork as much as the Democrats, they've got some legitimate
objections to the legislation in question.

Who wants to look through the bars at some reactionary Liberal conspiracy-
theory idiots and see how they rant and rave at the erosion of their populist 
support?  This is very typical of the elitist Liberal attitude that The People 
are incapable of thinking for themselves.  This elitist attitude will be the
eventual undoing of the arrogant liberal tide sweeping America, as The People
begin to realize more and more that they are being treated like errant children
and robbed of their freedoms by a bunch of Utopian arrogent socialist jerks.

Although I find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale
of Mr. Limbaugh, I find him entertaining and I often agree with his 
conclusions.  The fact that he sends liberal reactionaries like these
idiots through the roof makes him all the more entertaining.

Actually, I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating
skills sometimes lacking, even though his conclusions are often correct.

I would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated 
political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the "right" things
(where "right" is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement)
is showing an acute case of "myopic social perspective", not to mention
arrogance and utter stupidity.

Limbaugh is certainly far from perfect, but his opponents in the established
body politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of
virtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry, and for the elimination
of local control over Affairs Public.  

Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated 
like errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic 
people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the "oughta-be's"
inside their own hopelessly closed minds.

OK, let us take your word for that and work with it.  A nice specific

Hmmm, "Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion,
nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof."  Liberal translation: "the
federal government (as long as it is run by Liberals) may force local
school districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays,
while prohibiting others."

I think Limbaugh has you on this one.  It seems to me that he is arguing
for LESS imposition of the federal government into religion.

Nice job on the specificity of that one, too.

Ah yes, it is a conspiracy of profound proportions.  Methinks that you
may be a bit resentful of Mr. Limbaugh's success because you attribute it
primarily to luck (how, after all, could anyone with profound differences
of opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of
conspiracy or blind luck!)  Do you feel this same level of knee-jerk
resentment against lottery winners, or do you congratulate them on their
good fortune?

This should be great fun, since it is the Liberal movement in America
that is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People
and business (government/business 'partnership' indeed), and Mr. Limbaugh 
is the populist nemesis of that movement.

I have read Mr. Limbaugh's book, and although it was not the most literary
piece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain "venom"
at all, let alone "venom" comparable to an individual who callously murdered
millions out of racism.



>On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society

A very serious tone in that oratory.

You neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show, 
BTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather
than blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention 
that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions.
He also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be
intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much).
This is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is
treated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.

I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just
kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and
needed to be exterminated.



>On Religion as the Basis of a Nation
>        Hitler: "In this world human culture and civilization are

>sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the 
>expulsion from Paradise." (Page 581.)

This is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since
Christ was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of
the Aryan as "the highest image of the Lord" fits with Christian doctrine.



>        Limbaugh: "America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... 
>But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or 
>ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a 
>charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools 
>for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of 
>American education has declined ever since?" (pages 274-5.)

Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than
publicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo-
Christian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent
to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching
just a wee bit here.



>On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse
>        Hitler: "The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... 
>One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and 
>theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... 
>Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays 
>must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the 
>service of a moral idea of State and culture." (pages 346 and 348.)

Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment
industry here.


>        Limbaugh: "Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that 
>Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people 
>who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality 
>and monagamy. They disparage American heroes." (page 254.)

Just a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate
government control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show
to confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the
depraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control 
of Hollywood.

90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control 
of our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an
early age the "right" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr. 
Limbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the "young heads full
of mush" hyperbole indicates.



>On the News Meida
>        Hitler: "The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of 
>gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass 
>by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the 
>people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of 
>slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews." (Page 331.)

Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for
government power to be used to break up the conspiracy.



>        Limbaugh: "Elements of The Media have jumped on the

>and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania." (pages 270 and 268.)

Indication here that "Elements of the Media" (since career is a self-selected
categorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in
the populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable.
No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only
that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the
situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.

You may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable 
opinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his 
audience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that 
purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree 
or other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who 
is being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?

Again, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would
oppose government control of the media.

It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance.
Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people
who disagree with them.  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology
on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons?
Perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that
they exist in your mind, not the real world.

Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve
Rush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading
laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.

As to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings.
Mr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend
of government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism
in America through "business/government partnership" and increased levels
of taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes
in grade school.

Hmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler
because he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of
racism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to
racism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear 
racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal 
Left.

The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked
on the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized
Education, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to 
that Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear
to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush 
Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than 
the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.

Probably, law enforcement people (Park Service Police and D.C. cops),
who will use aerial photographs and extrapolate based on the
density of the crowd in small regions.

These sort of techniques derive from Army Intelligence and CIA
methods of estimating troop strength, and tend to be
methodologically skewed to always come up with inflated numbers,
so as to justify bigger budgets.

The Selective Service Registration should be abolished.  To start with, the
draft is immoral.  Whether you agree with that or not, we don't have one now,
and military experts agree that the quality of the armed forces is superior
with a volunteer army than with draftees.  Finally, the government has us
on many lists in many computers (the IRS, Social Security Admistration and
Motor Vehicle Registries to name a few) and it can find us if it needs to.
Maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time.
Let's axe this whole department, and reduce the deficit a little bit.

Even if Brett's eventual-return figures were correct -- and they
clearly weren't -- he'd still be wrong about the cause for the '86
blip because he fails to consider 2 basic factors:

1) As Ted notes, not everyone is a long-term investor.  One might find
oneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term
that require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting a
few weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with
preferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.

2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of
what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects
beside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to
unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to "sell now and save on
taxes."  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar
advice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice
was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986),
but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates
(without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).

It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal
economic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless
pulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describe
accurately what happens in the real world.

when we can.  In case you didn't realize it, the natural disasters [ oops,

I guess you missed the show on Ch 20 earlier this week about the disaster

Unless Dennis's parents were excentric in their naming a girl with
a boy's name I strongly suspect that abortion might be a medical service
that his insurers were not counting on him requiring.


When an insurance company attempted to set up lower rates for non smokers
in the early 80s they got spiked by the tobacco industry. Anyone know what
the current status is on the smoking issue?


If Denis really wants to have a "fair" insurance premium I take it he would 
be willing to have DNA fingerprinting done so that the company could weed out
all but the cast iron non risk cases?

US health financing system sucks, certainly its killing a hell of a lot of
people every year.

What's the difference, in practice?

It amounts to your saying, it's disgusting but should be legal,

someone else saying, let's allow the parties involved to decide what is
disgusting.

Or, if you're like me, you think that it ISN'T a coercive law, because
some children can't make informed consent.

You seem to be saying that a LIMITED government will provide MORE
opportunities for private interests to use it to pursue their own
agendas, and asking libertarians to prove that this will NOT happen.
While I can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that
if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become
a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area.
I rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is
more likely to become such a tool, and that it IS such a tool in many
instances.

I suspect that this is because "improvement in the human condition" as
you define it is not the primary goal of libertarianism, and would not
be the primary goal of a libertarian government.  My impression of
libertarianism is that its primary goal is the elimination of
government coercion except in a very limited cases.

Could it be because you're British, Phill, and living in Germany?
While the EC working rules are more liberal than what we have in
the 1989 US-Canada FTA, there's probably a law about that (having
health insurance coverage is a condition of my being down here,
for example).

You have mentioned this once before, yet both the NY Times profile on
the German sickness funds (late Jan.) and pamphlets that my girlfriend
gives to her language students from the German consulate both say that
it is "voluntary" (okay, there were quotation marks (-;) and that only
90% of the population is covered by the sickness funds (analogous to
our provincial health insurances, but not divided by province/state).

Another guy in health care policy says that the Turkish guest workers
aren't covered ... he's written to me a couple of times (he's not a
post-er).  I'll ask him ...

Who compared Quayle to Gore?  Mark said he had never heard of any incident
in which the thrower of the ceremonial ball had been booed before.  I mentioned
another incident.  (And if the media had a liberal bias, I'm sure he would
have heard of the Quayle incident.)

If I was to compare Quayle to anyone, it most likely would be Elmer Fudd.

Perhaps 1%, but most likely not more than 2%.  A new study

With yet another tax being floated by the Clinton administration to
pay for new ``free'' social programs, I've really begun to suspect
that the Canadians, long resentful of their place in the American
shadow, brainwashed an American draft dodger who fled to Canada some
time between 1966 and 1968, tutored him in the ways of Canadian
socialism, awarded him with smokeless marijuana cigarettes when he got
the correct answers, then returned him to the states (under the
control of the domineering wife assigned to his case) to attain high
public office and destroy the evil individualistic and free market
forces in America, thus shaping America in the Canadian image.

Pardon me for interrupting, but why doesn't anyone ever bring up other
possibilities besides more government, less government, or no government
and stop there? It seems to me that the problems with society go MUCH
deeper than government. Democracies seem to reflective of the majority
of society, both the good and the bad. If you take away the government,
you still have the structural flaws in society, except this time, with
no restraints. Yes? No?
	Why doesn't anybody ever discuss communal society, like a
kibbutz? I never studied it on depth, but from what I've heard, the kibbutz
in Isreal was very successful. It is also very close to what Aristotle
and Socrates believed was the best.
	Sorry to detract from the discussion.

But what good is change if there is no tracable improvement in the human
condition? Who would ever support the change if you tell them it won't 
improve their lives? I know that there are, and will be, libertarians 
who will jump in now and say that it WILL improve our lives. I can deal
with that. All I'm saying is that improving the human condition must
be the PRIMARY goal of any organization.

                    Office of the Press Secretary
_____________________________________________________________________
For Immediate Release                                  April 15, 1993


                            PRESS BRIEFING
                           BY DEE DEE MYERS

	     
                          The Briefing Room


9:45 A.M. EDT

	     	  
	     Q	  Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed? 
	     	  
	     MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we 
put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national 
police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to 
10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At 
11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on 
his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At 
12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval 
Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations.
Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the 
various groups.
	     
	     Q	  A photo op with Vessey?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.
	     
	     Q	  Why?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.  
	     
	     Q	  What about the lunch?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.
	     
	     Q	  Is he meeting with any congress people today?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.
	     
	     Q	  There are no meetings --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today, 
no.
	     
	     Q	  Has the President been given any information by the 
Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report 
from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the 
Vietnamese on that subject?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order 
of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll 
discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the 
parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't 
drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's 
something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese 
about first.
	     
	     Q	  Did the President talk with any Republican senators 
yesterday about the stimulus package?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.
	     
	     Q	  How many times?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last 
night.
	     
	     Q	  What was the outcome of that?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind 
of an agreement on a jobs package.
	     
	     Q	  Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any 
way flexible on this?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going 
to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll 
continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some 
kind of an agreement.
	     
	     Q	  Did they discuss the VAT tax?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.
	     
	     Q	  Can you check that?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Sure.

	     Q	  So what are they -- is the President offering to 
scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down 
to where Dole will sign on?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it 
as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs 
package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as 
we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the 
moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress 
including, obviously, Senator Dole.
	     
	     Q	  Is he talking to anybody else?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other 
Republicans yesterday.
	     
	     Q	  Is he talking to anybody today?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I 
wouldn't rule it out.
	     
	     Q	  We were led to believe that the President called 
Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the 
conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several 
people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the 
stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation 
he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the 
conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business, 
but it was both.
	     
	     Q	  In the President's mind, are they linked 
politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the 
stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to 
the American people?  Has he made that argument?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what 
arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed 
to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people 
first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional 
Russian aid last night in Tokyo.
	     
	     Q	  But does the President believe that the stimulus 
package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for 
Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to 
continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs 
package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs 
package through the Congress.
	     
	     Q	  Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating 
now with Dole?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.
	     
	     Q	  On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over 
the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they 
had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the 
Senate for the jobs package.
	     
	     Q	  But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other 
than Shelby?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a 
vote.
	     
	     Q	  What about Kohl?
	     
	     Q	  Kohl and Feingold?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll 
continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to 
bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of 
the members of the United States Senate support the package.
	     
	     Q	  If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold, 
why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of 
projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose 
funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.
	     
	     Q	  No Democrats.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.
	     
	     Q	  Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any 
other Republicans again today?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but 
again, I wouldn't rule it out.
	     
	     Q	  Does he plan to put out any more press releases to 
any other states today?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of 
breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I 
think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those 
up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest 
how their states would benefit from this package.
	     
	     Q	  Will you share those with us?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.
	     
	     Q	  Do you have copies of the ones you sent --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And 
we certainly can continue to provide them today.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent 
stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has 
been given?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think 
the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was 
something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he 
has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add 
to that.
	     
	     Q	  But he also said that business and labor groups are 
telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going 
to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that 
there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't 
think he said he was directly contacted by them.
	     
	     Q	  Are we to take that to mean that the administration 
has sounded out business and labor groups on this --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public 
discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think 
I want to add to that.
	     
	     Q	  In February, though, the President said that this 
was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What 
has happened between then and now to cause this administration to 
change its mind?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is 
something that the working groups are looking at.  They're 
considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to 
specific options that will be covered by the President's health care 
plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision 
on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.
	     
	     Q	  You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being 
considered by anyone in the White House after the President's 
comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.
	     
	     Q	  And then suddenly --
	     
	     Q	  What happened?

	     MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said 
throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options 
across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about 
and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added 
tax.

	     Q	  But the President himself took this off the table, 
Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility 
of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?

	     MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it 
hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are 
looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and 
no decisions have been made.

	     Q	  And it raises the question of how independently the 
task force is working.

	     MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider 
all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're 
considering all options.

	     Q	  But that's not the impression that the President 
left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something 
that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The 
clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was 
not on the table, not an option. 

	     Q	  "If it changes I'll tell you."
	     
	     Q	  Bring him on.

	     Q	  And you repeatedly referred to the President's 
remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna 
Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an 
orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers 
--

	     MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a 
Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not 
orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last 
couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We 
confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.

	     Q	  Is it because he has very few options?

	     Q	  Is this something that it will be incumbent upon 
the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has 
the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the 
task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in 
fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with 
the President?  

	     MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at 
this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their 
mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and 
the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I 
think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that 
context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been 
made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a 
decision on.

	     Q	  They will present it to him as one of his options, 
though he specifically ruled it out?

	     MS. MYERS:  Correct.

	     Q	  Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is 
this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to 
this form of taxation?

	     MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The 
working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number 
of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that 
they're looking at is the VAT. 

	     Q	  Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining 
this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period 
that you were telling us that it was not?

	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of 
their drafting of options is.  I don't know.

	     Q	  Who was telling you that it was not under 
consideration?

	     MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's 
comments.

	     Q	  Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise 
enough money to fund the core benefit package?

	     MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made 
on how to pay for the health care plan.
	     
	     Q	  I'm asking whether the projections --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how 
the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going 
to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so 
you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out 
until you know.

	     Q	  Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer 
models on a number of possible packages.

	     MS. MYERS:  Correct.  

	     Q	  The question is whether they have now determined 
whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest 
minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.

	     MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're 
not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being 
considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact 
details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for 
them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.  
	     
	     Q	  And when the President has been meeting with health 
care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing 
--
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Correct.
	     
	     Q	     they have never once said to him, these are your 
funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT 
in his --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific 
nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular 
briefings.
	     
	     Q	  Well, you have.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not 
considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.
	     
	     Q	  No, but you said that it has not been presented to 
him as an option.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Correct.
	     
	     Q	  That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of 
what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.
	     
	     Q	     specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't 
looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of 
paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?  
Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it 
works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if 
you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical 
discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were 
generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly, 
it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean, 
that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process 
of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.  
It's something that the working groups will present to him among the 
number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not 
going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where 
health care issues are being discussed.
	     
	     Q	  It's your statement from this podium that no 
discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that 
the option has not been presented to him.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  That is correct.
	     
	     Q	  Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand 
by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have 
nothing to add to what's already been said.
	     
	     Q	  Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin 
said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or 
considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made 
so that it would be less regressive?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what 
might happen if.
	     
	     Q	  But do you stand by the previous conversations in 
February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said 
you'd exclude food and energy --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific 
structure of a decision that hasn't been made.
	     
	     Q	  Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's 
comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working 
groups?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --
	     
	     Q	  Could you check for us, because that's a real 
important credibility question?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Sure.
	     
	     Q	  Since the task force was brought together this 
issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one 
fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in 
the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month 
and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be 
considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.  
It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has 
not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to 
add.
	     
	     Q	  Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of 
questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem 
with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if 
you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered 
while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if 
it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading 
us.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come 
out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.
	     
	     Q	  Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to 
indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or 
deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about 
this issue.
	     
	     Q	  All we were trying to find out --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out 
and I've given you the answers, Helen.
	     
	     Q	  We're trying to find out what changed -- what made 
it an option again.  That's the --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad 
mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.  
	     
	     Q	  Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you 
investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously 
considering and the President has not made a decision on.
	     
	     Q	  Yes, but he took it off the table in February.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll 
present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.
	     
	     Q	  Why would they consider it if he has taken it off 
the table?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table. 
	     
	     Q	  Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change 
his mind?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.
	     
	     Q	  Did he change his mind?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a 
decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's 
something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on 
this we'll let you know.
	     
	     Q	  So he must have changed his mind, right?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean, 
--
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he 
changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority 
exceeds the President's.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad 
mandate to look at all options; they've done that.
	     
	     Q	  Are you going to put out his income tax?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on 
his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be 
available. 
	     
	     Q	  Will there be any kind of briefing to go through 
it?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will 
be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you 
through the questions.
	     
	     Q	  We're used to be walked line-by-line through the 
presidential tax forms.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  Could we have one?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of 
a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer 
your questions about it.
	     
	     Q	  Did they file a joint form?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  When did he file it?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for 
Miyazawa?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the 
meeting.
	     
	     Q	  No backgrounder today?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.
	     
	     Q	  This is complicated stuff.  We need help.  
(Laughter.)
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in 
one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of 
force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it 
out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your 
thinking on whether or not to change your approach?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards 
Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --
	     
	     Q	  But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they 
people whose opinions would carry weight with you?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight 
certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've 
initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia, 
although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the 
Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on 
to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options, 
which we've been saying regularly.
	     
	     Q	  One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a 
straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not 
set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or 
tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them 
every day.
	     
	     Q	  Which doesn't work so --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.  
We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we 
support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on 
the 26th.  
	     
	     Q	  You say it's having an effect -- can you give us 
any documentation?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to 
you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.
	     
	     Q	  There's been no -- you have not been able to 
provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any 
effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia 
and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be 
happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if 
you'd like.
	     
	     Q	  We would like to hear from someone who can show us 
what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of 
the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't 
seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you 
provide something along those lines?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.
	     
	     Q	  On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced 
this morning -- where is that money coming from?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the 
details of that package.
	     
	     Q	  So that would be new money that you would hope to 
get?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the 
$1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have 
seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in 
Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.
	     
	     Q	  Isn't there a concern, though, about offering 
something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the 
concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do 
something immediately, which required money that was already approved 
in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit 
longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we 
announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional 
approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to 
work with Congress to make that happen.
	     
	     Q	  To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by 
Congress?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of 
conversations with members and will continue to work with them as 
this process moves forward.
	     
	     Q	  Was Christopher able to put this package out with a 
fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through 
Congress?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with 
Congress.
	     
	     Q	  In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is 
that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and 
the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs 
package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help 
give kids something to do.
	     
	     Q	  Who are they?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three 
organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police 
Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police 
Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union 
of Police Associations.
	     
	     Q	  Will the FBI chief be there?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.
	     
	     Q	  Or any other federal law enforcement officials?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these 
national law enforcement organization leaders.
	     
	     Q	  Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the 
$400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.
	     
	     Q	  So this would be the $700 million that's in the 
budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700 
million already in the budget.
	     
	     Q	  Is this going to be part of the supplemental or 
Fiscal '94 --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact 
funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.
	     
	     Q	  This $1.8 billion on top of --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400 
million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.
	     
	     Q	  And this is what prompted the President to call Bob 
Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was 
calling Bob Dole?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Correct.
	     
	     Q	  Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting 
with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some 
Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are 
complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House 
and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the 
other night, the satellite and all of this relationship.
Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these 
Chambers of Commerce?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)  
After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any 
attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of 
being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled 
by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local 
Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on 
this and other initiatives.
	     
	     Q	  What's the status of the President thinking about 
going to this Democratic retreat?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost 
certainly go.
	     
	     Q	  All three days?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be 
there yet.  
	     
	     Q	  Is it open to coverage?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.
	     
	     Q	  Is he going to have any kind of address, statement, 
anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't 
made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or 
what --
	     
	     Q	  Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it 
out.
	     
	     Q	  What about an AIDS czar?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's coming.
	     
	     Q	  Anything on the weekend?
	     
	     Q	  There's been a suggestion that he's going to this 
retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear 
or have any involvement in the gay rights march.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been 
discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic 
retreat.
	     
	     Q	  The weekend?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on 
right now is the radio address on Saturday.
	     
	     Q	  Any travel plans?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.
	     
	     Q	  He's not going to be off campaigning for his 
stimulus package?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.
	     
	     Q	  What about mid-week?  Anything likely?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely 
that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.
	     
	     Q	  Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.
	     
	     Q	  Going to name a drug czar this weekend?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.
	     
	     Q	  And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going 
to be focused on the stimulus package?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.
	     
	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.

    GORE JOINS STUDENTS IN ORLANDO FOR FIRST KIDS EARTH SUMMIT
    Will Take Part in Special Town Meeting On the Environment
 ******** SATURDAY, APRIL 17, 1993 - ORLANDO, FLORIDA **********

     WASINGTON -- Joining students from across the United States 
and around the world for the first ever Kids Earth Summit, Vice 
President Al Gore will travel to Orlando, Florida, on Saturday 
(4/17) and participate in a special town hall meeting, hosted by 
Linda Ellerbee for broadcast on Nickelodeon, to hear the young 
people's concerns and share ideas about the environment.

     The Vice President will take part in the "Kids World 
Council: Plan It for the Planet" from 2-5 PM (EDT) Saturday 
(4/17) in Orlando, Florida.  He will tour a display of student 
environmental projects, then videotape the town hall meeting 
where he will discuss with student delegates their concerns about 
the environment and their plans for an environmentally sound 
future.

     The town hall meeting will be moderated by Linda Ellerbee 
and taped for a news special, "Nickelodeon Special Edition:  Plan 
It for the Planet," which will air on Sunday, April 18 at 8 PM 
(EDT).  It is sponsored by Nickelodeon and the Children's Earth 
Fund.

     "Young people care about the environment because they know 
it affects our future.  Across the country and around the world, 
young people are speaking out about the environmental challenges 
we face.  They are identifying problems, thinking about 
solutions, and they are demanding action from their leaders," the 
Vice President said.

     The Kids World Council delegates are meeting for three days 
in Orlando to discuss how to save energy and switch to renewable 
energy.  They will be following the format and goals of the Earth 
Summit that took place last year in Rio de Janeiro.  The Vice 
President led the Senate Delegation to the Earth Summit.

     "I look forward to hearing what young people have to say 
about the environment and their future.  Their insight into the 
world around us is important," the Vice President said.

______________________________________________________________
For Immediate Release                             April 15, 1993     

	     
                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
                   TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS
	     
	     
                           The Rose Garden 


2:52 P.M. EDT


	     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen, 
two months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our 
national deficit and to increase our investment in the American 
people, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget 
plan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope 
and opportunity in the country.  
	     
	     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, 
which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed 
the House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support 
of a majority of the United States Senate. 
	     
	     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get 
the economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a 
fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  
Unfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate 
have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working 
the will of the majority on the jobs bill.
	     
	     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every 
state and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue 
is not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking 
for full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't 
care about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying 
the rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the 
table and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of 
dignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their 
families and drawing a paycheck.
	     
	     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of 
serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our 
economy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working 
with the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some 
of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs 
plan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on 
jobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet 
national needs.  
	     
	     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  
Today I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what 
size package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of 
the American people. 
	     
	     But even as we make those reductions and the package 
will be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the 
minds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is 
the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the 
dramatic rise in violent crime. 
	     
	     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an 
additional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities 
to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the 
fiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a 
matching effort by local governments, this could put as many as 
10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in 
communities all across our nation.
	     
	     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of 
violent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many 
people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their 
homes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments 
America can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that 
investment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.  
	     
	     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep 
the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no 
mistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I 
ever have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight 
for their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.
	     
	     I want to thank the police officers who are here today 
and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here 
that I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to 
rehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the 
summer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to 
talk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement 
concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country 
to have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and 
a brighter and more peaceful future.
	     
	     I say what I say today not just because it's good for 
law enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in 
these communities.  I have always supported community policing not 
only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, 
but because it cements better relationships between people in law 
enforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces 
the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the 
chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.
	     
	     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  
I promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put 
another 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four 
years.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind 
the core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.  
	     
	     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the 
jobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if 
you will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept 
the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to 
building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will 
create real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my 
part now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.  
	     
	     I want now to give the people who are here with me on 
the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the 
American people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished 
Attorney General.
  
	     
	     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * 
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that 
the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over 
the suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional 
dialogue?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --
they wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, 
I made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's 
a lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- 
people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden 
of the present system on many of our major employers, particularly 
many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the 
strength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision 
that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general 
tax.
	     
	     Q	  Do you personally believe that the American public 
is ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I 
mean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I 
will say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the 
benefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --
everyone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you 
streamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that 
there's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or 
over-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive 
care in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows 
absolutely massive savings to the health care system.
	     
	     The real question is whether you can transfer those 
savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have 
virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I 
have no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is 
the polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, 
they say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an 
affordable health care system.
	     
	     But I don't think that has anything to do with this 
stimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first 
and foremost.  They want that more than anything else.
	     
	     Q	  Now that you've announced your willingness to 
compromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of 
your package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer 
jobs is one.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the 
highway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let 
me say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime 
bill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a 
supplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think 
we need to do that.
	     
	     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the 
enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately 
and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people 
with AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be 
done.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the 
safety of the public depends on that.  
	     
	     There are a number of other things that I don't -- I 
don't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator 
Mitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole 
called me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call 
him back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we 
discussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said 
that I would not make any statements about any specifics until at 
least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could 
reach some accord.  
	     
	     So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been 
already, and let's see if they can talk it out.
	     
	     Q	  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator 
Mitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 
million, that you want that as part of the package?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word 
for Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator 
Dole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.  
But I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I 
wanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a 
reformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even 
more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the 
American people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly 
consistent with that.
	     
	     Thank you.

Excuse me?  WHO destroyed the BD's?  Last I knew, they burned themselves...
Prove to me that the FBI, ATF, or the Government in general either burned
the compound themselves, or that the BD's had no choice but to commit
mass suicide rather than coming out peacefully (a promise that was made
twice by Koresh himself, which he broke both times).

It is a pool of people who share a similer fear.

Adrienne, when you act to endander yourself or

Dennis, there are 1E6 things I pay taxes for, and that I don't approve
of, such as paying lawyers to postpone death sentences, creating
silly weapons that are never used, placing China as the preferred
nation while China doesn't have any human rights.

The democracy works by selecting the people you want to govern and 
to make sure that your opinion is heard. Remember what Spock said:
"the needs of the few outweight the needs of the many".

As long as government spending does not contradict the Constitution
I don't see any problems in a case where the people have selected 
a group of people to make decisions in one direction. And if this is 
bad, then we should elect a new government. Democratic systems work
this way, and I don't have anything against you raising an opinion
in your case. 

I just hope you realize that each individual should make their
own judgement, and posting pre-filled letters sounds like you
don't trust your fellow Americans to utter their own opinion,
just your own.

Cheers,
Kent

I totally agree.  Really, the only people this is going to benefit, are
those who live in the cities where the train stops.  Who wants to drive
to the train station from X (Lubbock for example)?  It's probably farther
to drive to the train station than it is to the nearest national airport.

I really can't see spending 5.7 billion on a system that only three cities
will benefit from.

Growth limits?  How will HSR help with the traffic congestion?  From what
I understand, the rail will not stop in places like Waco, or Bryan, or
lots of intermediate places in between.  Even though I live in Austin,
I don't see myself using the train except on rare occasions.  probably
twice a year.  And at $65 dollars a ticket I could probably drive for 
cheaper also. (even if the price of gas went up)

Here's my own top ten response to Mr. Ipser's list


10.  It's about time we have a President that might actually stand up to the
     military.  Our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not
     revolve around them, and that one of the things they're out there defending
     is our right to be critical of them, even denounce them.

9.   Let me explain something to you.  Environmental policy and industrial
     policy MUST go hand in hand.  Our nation, and indeed, our planet cannot
     afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years.
     Our industrial/environmental position has been downright SHAMEFUL! We
     must have active government support of the key industries such as,
     telecommunications, microelectronics, medical, biotech, and environmental
     tech.  Meanwhile weed out old, inneficient, high-polution, industries
     that are better left to other nations.  This will make us richer, help
     produce new jobs, and help the environment.  To give credit where credit
     is due, I heard a lot of this in a speech by Senator John Kerry (D-MA)
     tonite.  In addition, it's time we get really, really serious about 
     issues like overpopulation, globabl warming, and ozone depletion.  The
     planet on which we live should be our utmost priority!

8.   It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work,
     to provide the services that people need, and to help solve the problems
     that need to be solved.  Granted, some things can probably be done more
     efficiently for less money, and should be.  But some things are going to
     cost more money and I'm sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about
     taxes all the time.  You want to live in my country, you pay your fair
     share!

7.   I can't believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give
     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes.  If you're
     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an
     enemy which at best doesn't affect us and at worst really should be our
     friend, then you have no right to tell me you shouldn't pay taxes!

6.   Hey, I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60's-esque touch!

5.   Look, Canada, Europe, and Japan manage to provide health care for their
     citizens (and, yes, basic health IS a human right which people are
     entitled to).  If these nations aren't capitalist enough for you, then
     I guess we've found something better than capitalism!  There is nothing
     sacred about the capitalist system, and if something, be it socialism
     or anything else, works better, then I say let capitalism die.

4.   Make love, not War!

3.   Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to be a male and a feminist
     at the same time.  To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity
     to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong, and trying to force
     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse.  Women certainly 
     have as much to offer this world as men, and the day that gender
     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of
     the past few centuries seem like reform bills.  I look forward to it.

2.   See number 10.

1.   HEY MAN, ACADAMIA RULES!!

Excuse me for sticking my nose in, but any parent/parents who do not allready 
immunize their children (especially if it is already free), don't deserve one 
frigging dime of tax money for health care for themselves, or public health 
care service.

(I know the immunization program and the coming national health care issue are 
slightly seperate issues, but anybody who wouldn't help their kids, don't 
deserve my tax help).

Evidence given for her prostitute status, besides the admittedly 
questionable claim of the man on trial included:

1. Prior employment in a number of massage parlors, with women who
claimed that she worked as a prostitute;

2. Walking around a truck stop at 4:00 AM wearing a lace miniskirt,
a halter top, and no underwear of any sort;

3. Not having a purse or other I.D. with her.

Not enough to convict her, but enough to create reasonable doubt
whether a rape actually took place, or theft of services.

Are you just ignorant, or lying again?

The accounts on the evening news indicated that they claimed self-
defense, and the judge agreed that they were so operating.

No, it's that areas with a lot of wealthy breed socialists -- all the

    Male sex survey: Gay activity low

    A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough
    examination of American men's sexual practices published since
    the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2
    percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
    1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.

    The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday
    by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than
    the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional
    wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.

The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners.
The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3.
Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson,
and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that
homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
male population.  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for
straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically
how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.

Oddly enough, dependent coverage costs a bit more than for one self
alone.  But if you really believe your claims, you could make a lot
of money starting the "Homosexuals Health Insurance Co." and refuse to
insure "breeders."  But I shudder to think what your premiums will be
like.

This country is hardly ruined. In fact, it is booming compared to after the
1980 election.

This whole "USA has gone to hell and Reagan/Bush caused it", is not only lame,
pathetic, and old....... it's wrong.

Under Reagan/Bush the economy grew by 1.1 trillion dollars.  This is more than 
the entire economy of Germany, a "kind, gentle" country, in many peoples' 
books.  What a joke.

51 Arrested for Defying Judge's Order at Abortion Protest Rally
The Miami Herald, April 11, 1993

   Melbourne, Florida --   [...]

   Circuit Judge Robert McGregor's order prohibits anti-abortion pickets
   within 36 feet of the property line of Aware Woman Center for Choice.
   Even across the street, they may not display pictures of dead fetuses
   or sing or chant loud enough to be heard by patients inside the clinic.

   The protesters say the ruling all but wiped out the First Amendment
   to the Constitution.

   ``This is our sidewalk,'' said Joe Carroll, 33, a landscaper who
   marched with his children, Mary Grace, 8, and John, 7.

   ``I am not a rescuer.  I am not a trespasser.  It's just that this is
   my sidewalk.  I am not really protesting abortion.  We are protesting
   denial of our rights of assembly, religion, speech.  This judge is
   trashing the Constitution.''

   The children's grandmother led them away, sobbing, as Carroll and
   his father were arrested.

   Outside the clinic, Eleanor Smeal, president of the Washington,
   D.C.-based Feminist Majority Foundation, called for the Florida
   Legislature and Congress to pass laws as tough as the judge's
   order, which covers only Brevard and Seminole counties.

   ``This cannot go on,'' she said.  ``This is not freedom of speech,
   this is total psychological warfare with violence.  It is ridiculous
   to have to ask clinics to go court-by-court . . . to get protection.''

 EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE
 
 By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer
 
 SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the
 Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a
 nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than
 950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as
 12,000 people.
 
 Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco
 authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how
 operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and
 infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,
 right-wing and what they called "pinko" organizations.
 
 Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known
 organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting
 anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking
 any laws.
 
 Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to
 gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los
 Angeles and San Francisco.
 
 Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political
 spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan
 Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the
 Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish
 Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of
 directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San
 Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.
 
 People who were subjects of the spy operation included former
 Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.
 LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who
 is based in South Africa.
 
 Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was
 confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement
 agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and
 organizations was sold separately to the South African government.
 
 In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from
 police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony
 counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West
 Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify
 the search warrant.
 
 The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than
 25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.
 Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in
 San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation
 Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax
 attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not
 be reached for comment, his office said.
 
 Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a
 panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial
 recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a
 former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.
 
 The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied
 repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.
 League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an
 employee and have said they simply traded information with police
 departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.
 
 But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,
 San Francisco police alleged that "ADL employees were apparently less
 than truthful" in providing information during an earlier search
 conducted without a warrant.
 
 David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said
 the organization has not violated the law.  "There is nothing
 nefarious about how we operate or what we have done," he said.  "Our
 record speaks for itself."
 
 The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret
 fund used to pay for "fact-finding operations."  Lehrer, according to
 the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.
 Patterson.
 
 An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to
 a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending
 them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.
 
 Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for
 nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with
 San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many
 sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as
 "Skins" and "Pinkos," but that did not necessarily mean that they were
 under surveillance.
 
 "I might never see or call up on 99% of them again," Bullock said.
 "And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a
 threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,
 say, 'Pinko.'"
 
 In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police
 Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he
 was questioned by the FBI in the case.
 
 A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records
 and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,
 vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license
 photographs.
 
 Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and
 Bullock also provided information to the South African government,
 receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.
 
 The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the
 South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss
 nature of the spy operation.
 
 The file notes that Kraft's articles "appear frequently in The Times
 and are well researched and written," but little else about the file
 is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another
 Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong
 Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal
 information.
 
 Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how
 Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from
 skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash
 of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his
 own paid informants under code names such as "Scott" and "Scumbag."
 
 He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,
 exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,
 including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
 
 It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying
 on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African
 government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an
 agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the
 probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The
 Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather
 information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,
 Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and
 investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league
 offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of
 San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax
 Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to
 cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los
 Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that
 some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may
 have come from Los Angeles police officers.
 
 
 
 From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.
 
 ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION
 
 By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.
 
 SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a
 civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities
 who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential
 police information on citizens and groups.
 
 But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation
 League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many
 felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax
 violations and conspiracy.
 
 Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful
 about its spying operations, which collected information on more than
 12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political
 spectrum.
 
 Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show
 that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept
 files on political figures.
 
 Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down
 its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when
 deciding what charges to file.
 
 In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.
 Foxman described the ADL as "a Jewish defense agency which has fought
 to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80
 years."
 
 Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on
 extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing
 information to police, journalists, academics, government officials
 and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain
 information illegally, he said.
 
 "Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and
 physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or
 identity of any source of information," Foxman said.
 
 The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its
 longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than "a private
 individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'"
 
 Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements
 showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through
 Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.
 
 "Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be
 distanced from ADL," Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.
 Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.
 
 Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate
 with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn
 over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's
 offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.
 
 A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,
 produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial
 transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it
 will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.
 
 "The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,"
 the district attorney said.

What you fail to see is that in order to make a nightmarish stew of psychosis
and repression, you have to break a few eggs.  You the evil productive 
elements in society, are those eggs....

Damn the spirit, full speed ahead....

                            PRESS BRIEFING
                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS

                          The Briefing Room



1:04 P.M. EDT
	     
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good afternoon.  
	     
	     Q	  Could we do this on the lawn?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would be nice.  Let's go out 
to the cherry blossoms.  We'll do like the President.
	     
	     Q	  Is the stimulus package dead? 
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  
	     
	     Q	  Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You 
said it was a good visit, but no compromise.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk 
with Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there 
were no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very 
good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as 
well.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe 
Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not 
speak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the 
President was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close 
of that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the 
President about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked 
about that yesterday afternoon.
	     
	     At the close of that discussion they said that they 
would have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator 
was up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific 
compromises made on either side, they did say that they would 
continue to have some discussions.  And that's where we are.
	     
	     Q	  Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are 
both making concessions?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that it's at that 
phase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said 
consistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.  
He believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to 
take adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to 
make those adjustments.
	     
	     Q	  On the subject of a VAT --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.
	     
	     Q	  Can we stay on this for one more minute?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.
	     
	     Q	  We have a problem with the five minutes --
	     
	     Q	  I know no decisions have been made, but what would 
lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I'm not going to go 
down that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said 
this morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a 
number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked 
at.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been 
made.
	     
	     Q	  To follow, have they done that directly through 
him?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President 
about it?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although 
there's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the 
VAT.  But the President has not made a decision.
	     
	     Q	  At the meetings that he's had with his own task 
force advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the 
possible options would be?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that that has been 
presented for a decision, no.
	     
	     Q	  Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an 
option?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of 
briefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the 
President as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.  
	     
	     Q	  You're not saying he didn't know it was being 
considered, though, are you?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it's being considered.
	     
	     Q	  He knew that.
	     
	     Q	  But has he discussed that with his advisers?  
That's what I'm asking.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it's being 
considered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been 
over the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I 
don't even know that it's --
	     
	     Q	  But he didn't say he was considering, did he, at 
this stage?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we're 
getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is 
considered -- 
	     
	     Q	  Well, he is the one who said, I haven't reviewed 
it.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just 
repeated. 
	     
	     Q	  George, is there any concern here that as a result 
of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if 
it were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out 
the way it did, that there may now be the development of a 
credibility gap on this issue and others?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.  I mean, it is 
now public knowledge that this is being considered.
	     
	     Q	  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute 
statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it 
was off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it 
come out not from you people, but --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out 
from the administration.  What are you talking about?
	     
	     Q	  What I'm saying is, though, that the President said 
he would let us know. 
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.
	     
	     Q	  You people then said -- you said, I believe, that 
it's not going to be on the program.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.
	     
	     Q	  On March 25th. 
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.
	     
	     Q	  Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out 
by rooting around in the fine print of an interview
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do 
a very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is --
(laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys 
write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the 
Clinton administration, the headline is -- I'll look at it right 
here, and AP story -- "Clinton wants more money for spying."
	     
	     Q	  What about his remark that if it were being 
considered, he'd tell us about it?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration's concerned, 
and he'd let you know.
	     
	     Q	  And did he?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say 
this morning?
	     
	     Q	  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn't have to be dragged out of 
me.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of 
Health of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his 
administration.  That is his administration policy.
	     
	     Q	  Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they 
orchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they 
answered the questions.
	     
	     Q	  You're saying here that it didn't have to be 
dragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were 
considering it.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.  
Painfully clear.
	     
	     Q	  Was there a particular political strategy in making 
it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax 
day?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being 
considered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they 
answered that it was being considered.
	     
	     Q	  George, The New York Times --
	     
	     Q	  Why do it yesterday?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.
	     
	     Q	  The New York Times reports today that Secretary 
Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and 
oranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures 
in a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill, 
but which turned out to be totally false.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it was totally 
false, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor 
Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they 
say that. 
	     
	     Q	  The question is, is the President concerned about 
behavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what's he 
doing about it, if so?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a 
mistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the 
matter.
	     
	     Q	  Isn't that the same information that goes to the 
President?
	     
	     Q	  If I could go back to the stimulus package --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's two separate pieces of 
information.  I think that's where the confusion was.
	     
	     Q	  When did you all first learn about this mistake 
that was made?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.
	     
	     Q	  And as far as you know, is the President aware of 
it?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.
	     
	     Q	  And was he aware of it before he read about it in 
The New York Times?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  Not to my knowledge.
	     
	     Q	  Did you ever hear about it before this morning?  
Anything?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't.
	     
	     Q	  Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on 
this for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I'm not sure.  Both 
statements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that 
mixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said 
it was a mistake.  They said they wouldn't do it again.
	     
	     Q	  Did they drop it -- is this something that you 
choose to spin or make an issue of?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of 
work, we're gratified.  But that doesn't take away from the need to 
get this jobs package going.
	     
	     Q	  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a 
minute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an 
amendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment 
would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in 
the conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting 
that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there's no 
changes in the schedule at all.  I don't know that they discussed the 
timing like that.
	     
	     Q	  Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer 
this week than you were last week?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we're going 
to pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make 
adjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don't know where the 
votes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don't know what's 
going to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes 
deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.
	     
	     Q	  Has there been any indication that this situation 
has changed?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work on 
it.  We'll know when the votes are taken.
	     
	     Q	  George, last week you said that there are -- or 
various people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go 
through Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because 
he was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the 
compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could 
accept.  This week you're talking to him.  Is that because you've 
realized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's because Senator Dole wanted 
to talk to the President about the stimulus package.
	     
	     Q	  He initiated the conversation?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact, 
the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You 
say he's making --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that that's exactly 
what he said.  I think he said he didn't have any indication that 
there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise, 
and the President doesn't want to compromise.  And the President 
doesn't want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get 
it through, he will.
	     
	     Q	  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was 
working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before 
the actual vote.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's possible.
	     
	     Q	  Today?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when that will 
happen, but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward 
with some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come 
forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it 
passed.
	     
	     Q	  As we understood his conversations with Dole, the 
first one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you 
tonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase 
is.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a question of how 
detailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the 
package last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday 
afternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today 
in the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator 
Dole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific 
compromises at this date.  When we have something we'll let you know.  
And I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that 
we've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way.
	     
	     Q	  What are the follow-up discussions if not the 
President and Dole?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going 
to talk to Senator Dole.
	     
	     Q	  Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right, 
how about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the 
President, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was a negotiation 
in that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.
	     
	     Q	  Did they discuss actual numbers?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.  I know they 
talked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked 
about the programs they cared about.  I don't know if they got to the 
level of this many x-billion dollars. 
	     
	     Q	  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a 
package?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.
	     
	     Q	  Did the White House have anything to do with the 
protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole 
was speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.
	     
	     Q	  And has the President been in touch with Senators 
Kohl or Feingold?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he's talked to them, 
no.
	     
	     Q	  George, is the President considering the more 
palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the 
haves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going 
to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves 
having to pay for the have-nots?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that 
the tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his 
budget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your 
question, I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.
	     
	     Q	  George, on the subject of accuracy in information, 
you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money 
that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is 
not true.  It's actually waste water money.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's waste water money for 
Wisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee. 
	     
	     Q	  But it would not affect the drinking water problem 
because it's waste water money, right?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment 
overall. 
	     
	     Q	  But the implication from your statement the other 
day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.  
Would you agree that's not the case?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure of the specifics.  I 
know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.
	     
	     Q	  A leftover question from this morning, which was, 
when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating 
on a VAT?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when.  I just 
don't know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between 
the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.  
	     
	     Q	  So sometime since March 25th?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's right.  I don't know 
the exact date.
	     
	     Q	  George, the President this morning mentioned that 
some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the 
National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax 
being okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel 
that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed, 
or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already 
proposed?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we've said all we have to 
say about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there's just no -- this is 
being considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.  
The President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that. 
	     
	     Q	  But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't 
be to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the 
income tax, for instance?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on 
that.
	     
	     Q	  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress, 
Senator Dole's press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you 
think -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it 
have a chance?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea. 
	     
	     Q	  Is that a consideration whether you all put it 
forward?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration 
if the President were to decide to do it.  It's not in consideration 
now.
	     
	     Q	  You said at the beginning of the briefing that 
circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under 
consideration.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to 
this morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something 
that has to be considered.
	     
	     Q	  Those are the circumstances that have changed?  
That's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled 
it out that groups have asked it to be considered?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what he said. 
	     
	     Q	  Is that true?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin 
taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to get into the 
deliberations.
	     
	     Q	  But, George --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as 
the President said, groups came forward and said this is something 
you ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it. 
	     
	     Q	  Is that the only thing that's changed since his 
prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Can you explain how those groups -- how that 
information got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading 
the newspaper or did groups make presentations?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know, 
the health care task force has met with dozens of groups.
	     
	     Q	  But this is the President's knowledge that these 
groups had come forward.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what 
was coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been 
published positions in the newspapers.
	     
	     Q	  Have certain groups briefed him on the group's 
presentations to them?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've briefed him 
-- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the 
working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these 
groups.
	     
	     Q	  What kind of arguments did the groups make that 
were persuasive enough that the President would change the position 
that he had enunciated previously?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know, it's just they've had 
longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance 
health care.
	     
	     Q	  The President wasn't aware of those longstanding 
positions?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.  
Obviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the 
basic arguments for and against a VAT tax.
	     
	     Q	  What we're trying to figure out here -- you're 
telling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this 
change in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February 
and now --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's attitude hasn't 
necessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.
	     
	     Q	  I know, but the President said that it was off the 
table.  So did you.  And you're saying that the only thing that's 
changed is the positions of these groups, except you're also 
describing them as longstanding positions.  I don't see the change.  
If these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been 
made to the President --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they've made the 
presentations to the health care task force.
	     
	     Q	  There's no relationship at all between the fact 
that sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he 
favored will not produce enough revenue to finance --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he ever suggested 
that they would produce all the revenue.
	     
	     Q	  Well, he suggested that he thought that those were 
appropriate ways to finance health care.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don't know that 
he said anything to refute that.
	     
	     Q	  But, in fact, has the task force discovered that 
there wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind 
of core benefits --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't think that the task 
force ever suggested that there would.
	     
	     Q	  George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break 
his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his 
programs?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't comment on a hypothetical 
situation.
	     	  
	     Q	  But does that promise -- would that promise not to 
raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him 
from seeking a VAT tax?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions 
on the VAT tax.  When he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the 
implications then.
	     
	     Q	  Which specific groups can you cite -- business, 
labor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task 
force has prompted this consideration?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have the specific.  I just 
don't have that.
	     
	     Q	  George, can you tell us to what extend these other 
alternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or 
other financing options are also still on the table and what these 
options are?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force 
and representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking 
at a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that 
there are 20 different options under consideration.  But I'm not 
going to comment --
	     
	     Q	  What's the scope --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not going to comment on 
them, no.
	     
	     Q	  What's the scope of the need?  How much are you 
talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the 
--
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what the health care task 
force is looking at.
	     
	     Q	  Since there's not going to be any briefing on the 
Miyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the 
President hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his 
task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and 
the remark about market access at the press conference?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?
	     
	     Q	  Does no mean yes.
	     
	     Q	  Yes and no.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know.  I saw the 
Prime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question 
about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when 
he was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that 
certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the 
President.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and 
the U.S. that we want to do something about.
	     
	     Q	  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he 
suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in 
terms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state 
our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit 
very clearly.  I don't necessarily want to agree with your 
characterization of the Prime Minister's comments.
	     
	     Q	     that we need specific export targets, specific 
numerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with 
Miyazawa?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're going to have a broad 
discussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don't want to get into 
those specifics until after the meeting.
	     
	     Q	  Why?
	     
	     Q	   That's the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or 
not -- does the President believe that without specific numerical 
targets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of 
hopeless that this is going to change very much?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must 
have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not 
want to get into the specifics of how that would be done.
	     
	     Q	  But does the President believe that their stimulus 
package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants 
to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister 
Miyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it.
	     
	     Q	  How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to 
be some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary 
Christopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do 
more, the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we're going to continue to 
work with all our allies in the G-7, and we're going to continue to 
press for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I 
think that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and 
we're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral 
packages.
	     
	     Q	  Do you think the Japanese need to do more?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work 
with all our allies to do as much as we can.
	     
	     Q	  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today 
Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on 
the Bosnia policy.  And he said, "It's a rather emotional response."  
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.
	     
	     Q	  Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White  
House condone that kind of remark?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary 
Christopher's remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also 
that this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find 
answers for. 
	     
	     Q	  But that specific -- "rather emotional response" -- 
specific term?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.
	     
	     Q	  In connection with that, doesn't it seem that with 
the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it 
good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now 
to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?
	     
	     Q	  To take stronger action, to take military action -- 
air strikes, anything that can be done?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what 
must be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as 
you know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms 
embargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase 
pressure at this time.
	     
	     Q	  What is your response to the critics who would say 
that the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain 
the presidency?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're wrong.  We're pressing hard 
for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We're pressing hard 
for increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the 
arms embargo.
	     
	     Q	  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen 
getting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said 
that military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that 
change your thinking?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we're going to listen to 
whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to 
say.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions 
and talking about the arms embargo.
	     
	     Q	  A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She 
said she would be able to provide some administration officials who 
could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are 
you going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's what she said.
	     
	     Q	  That's exactly what she said.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's true.  But 
what she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of 
evidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are 
connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and 
we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have 
an effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute, 
what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact 
effect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods 
into Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What 
kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't 
know.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at 
all, I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much.
	     
	     Q	  Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be 
released?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a joint tax return.  
And it will be probably later today.
	     
	     Q	  Is the President considering signing an executive 
order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work 
force as part of the gay rights march here next week?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think there's any proposal 
for that at this time, not that I know of.
	     
	     Q	  It's something that the President promised during 
the campaign that he would do.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don't 
think it's anything that's on his plate right now.
	     
	     Q	  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point 
on this issue?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about on this issue.  
I assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian 
community sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of 
different groups and communities.
	     
	     Q	  Do you know if that's scheduled --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's probably going to be tomorrow.
	     
	     Q	  Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  It's a good thing you asked.
	     
	     Q	  Who's probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.
	     
	     Q	  How long --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  That's all I know.
	     
	     Q	  Do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?  
(Laughter.)
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what time it is.  I 
don't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow.
	     
	     Q	  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major 
speech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've asked, but 
I think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to 
give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it's not 
exactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like 
that.
	     
	     Q	  Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of 
the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know the specific 
timing of something like that, but it's certainly something under 
discussion and something we've been working on.
	     
	     Q	  Campaign finance reform?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on it.
	     
	     Q	  Do you think it will be next week?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.
	     
	     Q	  The biodiversity treaty is something you're working 
on?  I missed the question.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we're working on.  
He asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn't know 
anything about that but it's something we've certainly been working 
on.
	     
	     Q	  Do you know what organizations might be represented 
in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't.
	     
	     Q	  Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out 
of town on the day of the march?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got to be at the Senate 
meeting in Jamestown, and I believe he's also going to be giving a 
speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston 
on Sunday, as he did last year.
	     
	     Q	  Would you have told us if she had not pressed you 
on the question?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?
	     
	     Q	  On the gays.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the 
President's schedule for the day, certainly.
	     
	     Q?	    George, what day is the publisher's speech?  Is 
that Sunday?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a Sunday.
	     
	     Q	  And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one 
day?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I'm not sure.  I don't know how 
long the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don't 
know.
	     
	     Q	  You would have made the gay meeting public, right?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain if we had the meeting 
-- I don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you 
about it.
	     
	     Q	  I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the 
first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --  

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't say it was going to be in 
the Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn't -- I'm not say that it's 
not, but I didn't say that it was.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	     at the White House in the Bush administration 
gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White 
House had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make 
sure --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn't do 
anything like that.
	     
	     Q	  Certainly not.
	     
	     Q	  What marching orders did the President give to 
General Vessey?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for 
about half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was 
he had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will 
obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.  
The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting 
and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes 
in our policy towards Vietnam.  He'll be looking at Vietnam's 
response to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look 
into investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on 
remains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to 
military archives.  
	     
	     And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the 
activities of the joint commission and on the document.
	     
	     Q	  Vietnam says it's a fake.  What is the DOD analysis 
at this stage?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's not completed yet, and it's 
also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the 
Vietnamese.
	     
	     Q	  A number of Defense officials have been saying that 
they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact, 
non-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to 
as Americans from time to time.  Do people -- 
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don't have any final 
determination.  We're going to wait for the complete review; when we 
have it, we'll make a judgment.
	     
	     Q	  I know you don't have any final determination, but 
given all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that 
that's a likely possibility?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't want to characterize 
it in any way until the review is complete.
	     
	     Q	  George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech 
in Boston?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. 
	     
	     Q	  Is the President going to have a press conference 
tomorrow with Miyazawa?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so, but I'm not positive.  
Yes, I expect, yes.
	     
	     Q	  Was Toon in with Vessey?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes. 
	     
	     Q	  He was in on the meeting?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  What was the question?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey, 
and the answer is yes. 
	     
	     Q	  Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal 
report this morning the President's distressed about some of his 
press clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I 
think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied 
that the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would 
point out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than 
any of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --
	     
	     Q	  How many questions?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77 
occasions.
	     
	     Q	  How many were while he was jogging?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that's actually a very 
good question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the 
article also implied that these questions were only answered at 
tightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.  
He's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval 
Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to 
questions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --
	     
	     Q	  Oval Office press conference -- when was that? 
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's answered questions in the --
East Room.  He's had five in the East Room, he's had one in the Oval 
Office, he's had one in the Rose Garden, he's had one or two in the 
Roosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington 
Press Corps.  In addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local 
television anchors.  He's met with the editorial board of The 
Portland Oregonian.  He's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather. 
He's had interviews with local press from California, Florida and 
Connecticut --
	     
	     Q	  Can you address the question of the attitude?  The 
article implies that he doesn't --
	     
	     Q	  Why doesn't he like us?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  Did you really get blamed for that Post story?
	     
	     Q	  The story is that you -- are you held responsible 
for it.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think I'm going to comment 
about this.
	     
	     Q	  Are you denying that the President has shown 
displeasure publicly?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the 
discussions between the President and myself.
	     
	     Q	  Did the President write that letter to Chris 
Webber?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?
	     
	     Q	  The letter to the University of Michigan basketball 
player?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.
	     
	     Q	  That is an authentic letter?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Since the President first talked about the VAT in 
February, he said at the time that he thought there probably should 
be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.  
Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can't comment on a 
proposal he hasn't made.
	     
	     Q	  George, does the President have some agenda for 
this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a 
general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about 
including AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.
	     
	     Q	  The military issue?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain it will come up.
	     
	     Q	  Is he using this event to name the AIDS --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.
	     
	     Q	  George, what specifically is the President doing to 
prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's had briefing memos.  He's had 
general discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the 
Trade Representative and others.
	     
	     Q	     report yet?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he has the report 
referred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him 
today.
	     
	     Q	  He was?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Does he intend to use any of these instances that 
--
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know that the 
report's been presented.  But obviously, the President will press 
hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.
	     
	     Q	  In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was 
that there's a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he 
feels that way?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the 
record in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again, 
I think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The

                      Yigal et al, sue ADL
 
  Nineteen people, including the son off ormer Israeli Defence Minister Moshe 
 Arens, sued the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) on Wednesday, accusing the 
 Jewish group of disclosing confidential official information about them.
 
     Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art
 dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as
 defendants in the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.
 
     The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting
 anti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on
 them, including data from state and federal agencies.
 
     The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the
 governments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a ``a massive
 spying operation.''
 
     The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000
 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the
 plaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.
 
     Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately 
 available for comment on Wednesday.
 
     The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that
 Gerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit,
 passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy
 ring.
 
     The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and
 Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San
 Francisco and Los Angeles.
 
     The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California,
 which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official 
 sources.  It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as 
 other unspecified damages.
     
 Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the
 plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and 
 his wife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.
 
     One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the
 University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence
 Minister.
 
     Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on
 him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of
 Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.
 
     According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both
 kept information on thousands of California political activists.
 
     In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid
 Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and
 Bullock received confidential information from the authorities.
 
     No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and
 Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing.

The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14,
1993 issue of USA Today ("Drug Use Up At Younger Age" by Mike
Snider, p. 1A).

    Drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders -
    usually 13 - and they're using more LSD and inhalants like glue
    and air fresheners, says a new survey.

    The annual National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse finds
    "statistically significant increases" in eighth-graders' use of
    many drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, crack, LSD and inhalants.

    "We may be in danger of losing some ... hard-won ground (in reducing
    drug use) as a new, more naive generation of youngsters enters
    adolescence," says Lloyd Johnston, University of Michigan, chief
    researcher on the study sponsored by the Department of Health and
    Human Services.

    But drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decade-long
    decline.

    The study of 50,000 students shows the percentage who tried the
    following in the 30 days before they were polled:

        * 8th-graders  - alcohol 26%; cigarettes 16%; marijuana 4%;
                         cocaine 0.7%.

        * 10th-graders - alcohol 40%; cigarettes 22%; marijuana 8%;
                         cocaine 0.7%.

        * 12th-graders - alcohol 51%; cigarettes 28%; marijuana 12%;
                         cocaine 1.3%.

    Among 12th-graders, use of marijuana, cocaine and inhalants
    declined over the year before.  Not so with LSD.

    * 2% of eighth-graders have tried LSD in the last year, up 24%
    over 1991. 

    * Use of LSD among seniors is at its highest point since 1982; 6%
    tried it in the last year.

    Reducing drug use among students "requires a different kind of
    strategy" that Health Secretary Donna Shalala says will be part
    of an overall illness prevention plan.

    The survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighth-graders
    disapprove of them.

    "It's scary," Shalala says.  "Dealers are focusing on younger, more
    vulnerable kids."

The DEA and other organizations would have the American people
believe that we are winning the "war on drugs".  I'm going to
dispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showing
you the drug war's *real* status. To help prove my assertions
I've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearly
demonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on the
rise.  If WOD is working, as we're led to believe, then drug
abuse should have gone down substantially by now.  The reality
is, is that it has not gone down very much.  If anything,
substance abuse is on the rise.  I'm also going to supply a
possible solution to this problem.

The following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music
and pot entitled "Hello Again, Mary Jane" which appears in the
current issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59).

    Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing
    smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed.  "Perhaps
    because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby
    is out in full force," says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug
    Enforcement Administration.  "The fact is, they're losing the
    battle."  In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said
    they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner
    says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that
    studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of
    nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.

The chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993

Snider, p. 6D).

We are not winning the "war on drugs".  I think you can see that one
of the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that
the "war on drugs" is being won is to selectively quote statistics---
only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone
down.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is
an excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to
deceive the public.

Usage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same
time usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution).
Also, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down
but drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore,
if one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all*
the statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called "war on drugs" is
being lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs
go, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants,
then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed
in its true perspective.

For those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then try
drinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me
that it's not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal*
drugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless
attempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to
another drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.

The solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to
legalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be
within reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a few
times) and then couple this with a massive drug education program.
The reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution is
because people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the
government's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug
interdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug
education).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime because
the profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often
goes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact that
addicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their
money and posessions in order to support their expensive habit;
legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall
substantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.

IMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been
done to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to
employ heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating
them.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less than
they used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought
about by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can
light up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in
order to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methods
be used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried
out.  They are as follows:

    * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which
      states the possible health hazzards involved with using this
      product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.
      Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used
      ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.

    * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of
      revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs
      through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from
      drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law
      enforcement.

    * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of
      18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the
      taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.
      Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning
      information should also be a felony.

    * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the
      purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This
      agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad
      drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.

I'm sure that many of the things I've discussed in this article have
been hashed out before in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, I thought
it was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...)
all at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand on
WOD.  Go ahead and tear into my post; I'm sure there is something in it
that you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :)  BTW,
I posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove my
assertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths---
something which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in.

The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993
issue of USA Today ("Drug Use Up Among U.S. eighth-graders" by Mike
Snider, p. 6D).

    A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are
    using them and fewer deem drug use as risky. 

    For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results
    from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is
    being won.  But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by
    eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students
    nationwide.

    Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If
    drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will
    have fewer "drug-using contemporaries" who act as examples of
    substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,
    one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths "must be given
    the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,"
    Johnston says.

    This type of resurgence "is possible," says Eileen Shiff, author of
    "Experts Advise Parents" (Delta, $14.95).  But that's not the issue,
    she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today
    could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.

    Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with
    drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to
    their children.  "I've even seen parents serving kegs of beer" to
    their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,
    Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, "lock-in" party where
    no booze or drugs were allowed.  "We need to fulfill that parental
    role, otherwise the peer group takes over," she says.

    Officials may "talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven't
    done anything that I've seen," says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,
    Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and
    other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a
    member of USA Today's Teen Panel, says "there's always going to be
    experimentation" with drugs.

    A real war on drugs could be waged "education-wise," she says.  But
    "some don't want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give
    them ideas; it's the same with birth control.  I think you should
    give the kids the information or have it accessible" through classes,
    pamphlets and speakers, she says.

    Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in
    kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores,
    Fla.  "I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs).  I think
    kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds
    (about using drugs)," he says.

    Scare tactics in public service announcements aren't working; only
    one commercial has gotten it right, he says.  The commercial opens
    with two "good-looking girls" in the restroom talking about having
    no prom date.  Then they take a hit off a joint.  "That hits home
    because it's not attractive," he says.  "You can't be doing drugs if
    you want somebody to like you."

Yes, I saw today in 6 o'clock news on KCBS here in San Francisco
this statistic quoted. 

2.2% men had sex with another man.
1.3% cinsider themself homosexual.

I understand of course that because this statistic goes against
common believe and not PC-correct it must be complete BS.

Clayton, my man...

You are a tad out of touch....

First, gay comunities all over the country are in the process of excluding NAMBLA
from parades etc.

#2

Nobody from NAMBLA is gonna get a job in a day care centre.  The same liberals you are
upset about are also passing laws that make tough background checks for childcare
people.

#3

Tell me, how would you feel if your employer fired you for your antigay post on the
internet?  Would you be upset ?  I`ll bet you would be pissed!
To some, your posts ,ight make the company look bad.
While your posts offend me I dont think it would be right for you to get fired over
it.

I dont believe the gay comunity is asking for hiring quotas like the affirmative
action laws of the 60's did.
My understanding is that the gay community just wants the same rights the srtraights
have.  I dont think people should have their leases cancelled when their landlord
finds out they are gay.  I dont think that when someone sees someone walk out of
a gay business and then blabs it all over work that the gay person gets fired.
Do you REALLY think these are justified ?

#4

Clayton, I am told you are a parent a couple times over.
Have you been following the strip in the paper "For Better or For Worse" ?

I honestly want your opinion as a parent on the strip.  

Do you really care about your childeren
as much as friends of mine tell me ?  How much do you care about your childeren ?
How much do you care about other people's childeren?  Do you care about MY childeren?
Do you care about my sister's childeren ?

If one of your kids told you he/she was gay, would you throw them out of your home
in the middle of the night?

Would you approve of your childeren driving down to San Francisco to trow bottles
at and beat up on gay people?  Would you condone your childeren beating up on someone
elses childeren ?


I await your answers to these queastions.  PLease no flaming...
This is to be a civilised discussion, from one father to another.

You seem to be forgetting about the life of the mother.  You contend that
the life of the unborn child is more important than the crimes of the
father, but you label the stuggle of a rape victim to survive and put her
nightmare in the past as a matter of "convenience!"  Outrageous.

If you showed the same compassion for the pregnant woman that you do for
the unfortunate baby, I might have more tolerance for your views.  You
seem, however, to be intent on questioning a woman's wisdom in allowing
herself to be raped.  If you can, please understand that I am talking
about those cases in which the woman has no control over whether she
becomes pregnant...such cases do, in fact, exist.

Let me say this about that, as a retired Navy officer; 

I agree. Cut it.  But let's not stop there. 

Eliminate the C-17 transport. Overwight, overdue, overbudget, it was
supposed to carry tanks. New tanks are now too big for the airplane. 

Scrap the Seawolf SSN-21 nuclear submarine. The breakup of the USSR has
left us with a number of sticky military problems, but NONE of them will
require "God's gift to submarines". 

Ground the B-2 stealth bomber. I'm sure it's a great airplane that will do
EVERYTHING its designers said, but at half-a-gigabuck a copy, we can't
afford for even ONE to crash. And airplanes DO crash. 

Elmo Zumwalt said it best 20+ years ago; "High/Low". A MIX of a FEW
extremely capable weapons systems and a LOT of CHEAPER,
moderate-capability systems.

Also, it appears that two of the three Marines have some sort of charges

I would doubt any civil rights case would be in order for the point that you
mentioned.  Even if it were possible, I think it is a bad idea since it smacks
real strongly of double jeopardy.  A civil case for damages is fine since that
is a trial that would proceed regardless of the first.  I think a bad precedent
has already been set in the King trial in L.A. and something like this would
make it worse.  Regardless of how bad anybody feels about this decision, it
must stand that charges of assault were not not proven against the three
marines and that's how it should stand.

A more realistic offer would be:

Those who object to paying for abortion can instead pay for the (greater)
cost of delivery that those who couldn't afford an abortion (and wanted
one) would be forced to go through, while those of us who do not object to
public funding of abortions for those who can not afford medical care on
their own can pay for the (smaller) cost of an abortion for those who
decide that is what is best for them, but are unable to afford it on their
own.  Funny how those who object to paying *their* money to pay for *other's*
abortions end up paying *more* money than if they hadn't objected.  People
need to realize that where *your* individual tax money goes is a meaningless
concept.  It is probably unlikely that the fraction of your taxes that would
actually *on average* go towards such abortions would cover the cost of even
*one* entire abortion.  (Consider how many taxpayers there are, how many
abortions are performed, and how many would likely be paid for by public
funds, and how much you pay in taxes and how much a typical abortion would
cost.  I think the factors on the order of 1/1000 involved will swamp the
rest.)

(It's more realistic because we don't really object to paying for delivery,
etc for those women who *chose* that, but can't afford it.)

Part of what started this was my earlier example of Illinois, USA requiring
anyone doing more than X automobile transfers a year (X = 10, I think)
to become licensed as a used car dealer.  In addition, it requirs anyone
with a used car dealer's license to own at least 10 cars at a time, all the
time. 

Let me continue with this example and try to answer Steve's questions.

Steve, let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resell
cars.  Either you've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bump
up against these limits, or you would like to do it full-time but these
stupid, arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pulling
yourself up.  So I'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willing
to take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs, and you're
protected from doing what you want with your life.

Here's what I see libertarianism offering you:

Your money is truly yours; it belongs to you.  You can use it to buy a car.
If you use it to buy a car, it is truly your car; it belongs to you.  You
can use your money to fix up that car.  Since it is your car, you can sell
that car.

Your life is truly yours; it belongs to you.  It matters not if someone
thinks that it's "wrong" for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 months
rather than, say, 9 cars.  They may dissaprove, but it is not their life or
their money, it is your life and your money.

My money is truly mine; it belongs to me.  I can use it to buy a car.
Perhaps your car.  Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewhere
dissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying.

That someone could go to the government and insist that the government make
us stop it.  But the government would be powerless to stop us from doing
what we like with our own property, in the abscence of fraud or agression.
And it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other.

This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream, but basic human decency
and common sense.  A real grass-roots example of freedom and liberty.
And yes, not having a few people acting as our masters, approving or
rejecting each of our basic transactions with each other, does strike me
as a wonderful way to improve the human condition.

   Thanks awfully,
             Patrick

Impressive.

Let the "GREAT CHUCKMEISTER" make a couple predictions, if you
will:

1.  The sun will rise tomorrow.
2.  Rush will bash Clinton on his next show.
3.  I will turn out to be Clinton's love child.

Chances are, I'll get at least one of those right, if I'm lucky.
I may even get two.

Drive down to Cincinnati and take a look.  Not pretty, is it?
Things were much better there in 1980.  All that growth went into
the hands of Ron and Georgie's pals, and I DIDN'T GET A SINGLE
DIME OF IT, DAMMIT.  And, now, I'm gonna be bled to death by tax
leeches to pay for the damage.  F***ing great.

Oh, here's another thing.  Seems like a lot of people in 
Columbus drive over to Marysville and make Japanese cars.  Hm.
I wonder how many American-owned companies employ those in
Central Ohio?  Other than Ohio State University.  :)

Ok, one last time.  (yeah right)  In order for *you* to "not pay for any
abortions" through your tax money, *everyone* would have to "not pay for
any abortions" through tax money.  If this is the case, then women who
have reasons for "needing" an abortion, but are unable to afford it on
their own, are just "out of luck".  Their *choice* is blocked because of
econonmic hardship--which is part of why they might "need" the abortion
in the first place--and because *some* people don't want to "pay for any
abortions".  On top of that, there is the assumed requirement that the
governemnt pay the delivery costs for those women who can't afford it,
which will also include all of those women who could not afford an abortion.
This involves *more money*.

Suppose instead there *is* government funding of abortions for women who
desire them but can not afford one on their own.  Those who do not want
an abortion will have the costs of their delivery covered (if they can
not afford it on their own), and those who *do* want an abortion will be
able to get one and *save the government money* in the process.  How then
are you "paying for" an abortion?  Rather that abortion is "paid for" by
the cost of *delivery* that it *saves* (and then some), and all because
we remove the restriction against funding of a perfectly legal procedure.
(Notice that this does not apply to cosmetic surgery, which is often used
as an example of "elective surgery" that is not generally paid for just
because it is desired and can not be afforded.)

If you insist on complaining about "paying for" someone's choice to have
an abortion when they can't afford it, I will complain about "paying for"
the larger costs of *restricting* that choice when they can not afford it.
Why should you pay for someone else's choice?  Why should I pay more to
*restrict* someone's choice?

A pro-lifer who does not consider abortion an *extreemly* important issue
is an oxymoron.  If it's not important enough for you to vote the way you
feel because of "other issues", then why should anyone take your insistance
that "abortion is wrong" seriously?

It would be awfully nice if reputable poll institutions would have a *clear*,
unbiased poll on the issues of abortion.  In order to be unbiased there would
have to be allowance made for "shades of grey", rather than lump all of the
middle with one side by tricky wording--such as on the last poll I heard
about.  Of course, then we would know once and for all how the country
*really* feels about it, and then what could we argue about?

I think you are leaving out a great deal of other "value".  There is no
rational reason to give an "abortionist" a "value" 10 million times that
of a fetus.  (Why not 10 billion, for instance...oh, but then you would
loose on the deal.)

Instead we should look at what is *really* involved in each abortion.
There is the loss of a human life, a life that would otherwise have
eventually become a member of society.  That is certainly a non-zero
value.  There is the physical and emotional suffering of a woman who
finds herself with an unwanted pregnancy, and the greater suffering
caused by the refusal of society to allow her to deal with it.  That
woman is *already* a member of society.

I argue that the cost of suffering of a *real* member of society is
far greater than the loss of a *potential* future member of society.

Now, as for your "deal".  Suppose you "pay" the value of all the suffering
of every woman who *was* denied an abortion, or *would have been* denied
an abortion, under your desired position.  And "we" will "pay" the value
of all the potential future members of society that never became a part of
it (or *would* not have been a part of it, under *our* desired position).

Think about it.

Of course, I expect you will object to my argument that suffering of
on-going life is worse than loss of just-starting life.  If so, please
put forth some rational argument for how the life of a (currently)
non-sentient creature is somehow worth the suffering of a sentient being.
(I figure if I ask enough places, and such an arguement exists, I should
eventually see it.)

I agree with most of what Phill says, except the point about it being in
our interests to bring down the oil price.  Consider that both the U.S.
and Great Britain have domestic sources to partly satisfy 
their energy needs.    Pricy OPEC oil impacts both Germany,
Japan and many other "industrial rivals" more than these two.  
In addition, the proceeds from the sale (especially by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
U.A.E. etc) are disproportionately reinvested in the U.S. and G.B., 
propping up these economies and further providing an incentive 
to keep prices from falling too low.

I get it.  One organization wants to abolish age of consent laws,
whereas in contrast the other wants to abolish age of consent laws.
This makes it respectable to belong to one organization, but not the

OK.  I stand corrected.  I guess, then, that the comments about payoffs
(i.e., "pork") to Puerto Ricans that others have been making still
stands?

Now, everybody, how about some opinion on the following related topic:

Should the people who are natives of U.S. territories have
representation in the U.S. House of Rep's or the U.S. Congress?
The U.S. Constitution sets up the House of Representatives to represent
each State in proportion to its population, and the Senate to represent
each State equally.  What should be done with U.S. territories like
Puerto Rico?  Does anyone have knowledge about how this was handled in
the past, such as with the Louisiana Territory or the Northwest
Territory?

FURY OF MOTHER NATURE

Man's contribution to environmental "pollution" are paltry compared to those 
of nature. In her exceptional book TRASHING THE PLANET, former Atomic Energy 
Commision Chairman Dr. Dixie Lee Ray notes based on the available data, "all 
of the air polluting materials produced by man since the beginning of the 
industrial revolution do not begin to equal  the quantities of toxic 
materials, aerosols, and particulates spewed into the air from just three 
volcanoes: Krakatoa in Indonesia in 1883, Mount Katmai in Alaska in 1912, and 
Hekla in Iceland in 1947." To which could be added Mount St. Helens in 
Washington State in 1980 (which pumped out 910,000 metric tons of carbon 
dioxide alone). El Chicon in Mexico in 1982 (which sent more than 100 million 
tons of sulfur gases into the stratosphere), and Mount Pinatubo in the 
Philippines (which in 1991 hurled upwards of 30 million tons of material into 
the stratosphere).
LOS NINOS
Many environmentalists attributed the 1988 drought in the U.S. to global 
warming, but researchers with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in 
Boulder Colorado reported that the freakish weather was actually due to a 
natural phenomenon, the interaction of El Nino and El Nina, two massive 
currents in the tropical Pacific. El Nino is a huge strip of warm water that 
periodically appears off the coast of South America and disrupts the world's 
weather patterns. Now and then, it alternates with El Nina, a mass of cold 
water that comes from the ocean depths along the equator and drifts for 
thousands of miles.
CHICAGO TRIBUNE'S  Peter Gorner summarized the phenomenon: "Cold water along 
the equator clashed with warmer than normal water southeast of Hawaii. The 
result was both the U.S. drought and the devastating floods that swamped 
Bangladesh...... Nina's cooler water disrupted tropical weather patterns and 
distorted the path of the Jet Stream across North America. Then the Jet 
Stream shoved rain-producing weather systems away from the interior of the 
U.S. resulting in drought."
TERMITE TERROR

Sundry animals and insects also contribute their share to environmental 
"degradation. TIME for April 20,1992 noted that in "the Netherlands... manure 
from pigs poses a major ecological threat, defiling water supplies with 
excessive nitrites and acidifying local soils. Sheep have permanently scarred 
the landscape in Spain and Portugal, while in India ... bovines [cows] are 
ravenous wraiths whose constant quest  for food drives them to ravage 
standing forrests."
The February 1983 issue  of SCIENCE DIGEST reported that "an international 
team of researchers has discovered that termites generate more than twice the 
Carbon Dioxide  that fuel burning does." According to a study reported in 
SCIENCE for November 5, 1982, the "estimated gross amount of Carbon Dioxide 
produced [by termites] was more than twice the net global input from fossil 
fuel combustion." In addition, "Termites are a potentially important source 
of atmospheric methane: they could account for a large fraction of global 
emmisions." The wood-eating pests have a bacteria that enables them too 
digest carbon so efficiently that some 90 pe is converted too Carbon Dioxide, 
methane, and other gases they belch into the atmosphere.
Ants are another natural source of "pollution." In 1987, an atmospheric 
chemist with Bell Laboratories, and zoologists from Cornell University, 
reported that ants of the subfamily FORMICINAE make and store huge quantities 
of the formic acid that contributes most of the acidity of rain that falls in 
remote areas and is found in atmosphere gas and precepitation around the 
globe. It is abundant, for instance, in the fog and mists that hang over the 
rain forests of Central Africa. According to the July 6, 1987 INSIGHT 
magazine, the "ants release the acid when defending themselves and 
communicating with each other and upon dying. Since  30 percent of the world 
ant population belongs to this subfamily, there is significant concern about  
the acid the ants release," an amount estimated at "600,000 metric tons 
annually." which is equal to the combined formic acid contributions of 
automobiles, refuse combustion and vegetation."
Clearly, man has a long way to go to match nature as a "despoiler" of the 
environment.

The following statement was released
on February 27,1992 by the Science &
Environmental Policy Project

As independent scientists researching atmosphere and climate problems, we are 
concerned by the agenda for UNCED, the United Nations Conference on 
Environment and Development, being developed by environmental and  activists 
groups and certain political leaders. This so called "Earth Summit" is 
scheduled to convene in  Brazil in June 1992 and aims to impose a system of 
global envionmental regulations, including onerous taxes on energy fuels, on 
the population of the United States and other industrialized nations.
Such policy initiatives derive from highly uncetain scientific theories. They 
are based on the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming 
follows from the burning of fossill fuels and requires immediate action. We 
do not agree. 
A survey of U.S. Atmospheric scientists, conducted in the summer of 1991, 
confirms that there is  no consesensus about the cause of the slight warming 
observed during the past century. A recently published research paper even 
suggests sunspot variability (which is directly proportional to solar 
activity),  rather  than a rise in greenhouse gases is responsible for the 
global temperature increases and decreases recoded since about 1880.
Futhermore, the majority of scientific participants in the survey agreed that 
the theoretical climate climate models used to predict a future warming 
cannot be relied upon and are not validated by the existing climate record. 
Yet all predictions are based on such theoretical models.
Finally, agriculturalits generally agree that any increase in carbon dioxide 
levels from fossil fuels burning has beneficial effects on most crops and on 
world food supply.
We are disturbed that activists, anxious to stop energy and economic growth, 
are pushing ahead with drastic policies without taking notice of recent 
changes in the underlying science. We fear that the rush to impose global 
regulations will have catastrophic impacts on the world economy, on jobs, 
standards of living, and health care, with the most severe consequences 
falling on developing countries and the  poor.

[Lots of good points re Mormons in the US]

The founding fathers of the US were hardly great on religious freedoms. At
least one history I have read formed the opinion that they left for the
US not to practice religious freedom but to practice religious intolerance.

I don't think that my lot were particularly mainstream in those days either.
Mind you like the Budhists I somehow doubt the Quakers would ever form a
militant religious fanatic movement.

Wooa there!!! I have a classic car. If I buy a body pannel for $300 after
being told that it is genuine BL and discover that it is a non original
copy value $50 I get real pissed. If I can get the genuine article I will
pay a lot for it because not only will it cost much less to fit (probably
meaning that its cheaper overall) but it also means that the car is worth
a hell of a lot more. Even on a twenty year old car there is a big
difference in a baddly restored car where much of the work needs to be
redone and a concours classic. I got mine for 600 quid because it was
in a shitty state from bad repairs. If it had been well repaired it would
be worth a hell of a lot more.

Are you really saying that Ford and GM are having companies beat up for
infringing copyright on parts they don't make? I find that very hard to
beleive. In the UK they are very sympathetic - Ford recently dug out
the Cortina Mk I body press so that some company could make a few more.
BL does amazing stuff, they kept the entire assembly line for the MGs
and helped set up a company to remanufacture new bodyshells.

There is a hell of a difference between remanufacturing and passing off.
The former I can't see anyone trying to stop. Most car cos see classic
vehicles as a damn good ad for them. The latter though is fraud. If a
part is described to me as real GM and money taken under that assurance
when they know it ain't GM that's fraud.

It really is odd. I post saying that the US govt does appauling things
under Regan, Bush etc. in foreign policy. The right get really pissed. 
Then when I point out that nobody seems to have posted a better suggestion
as to how to solve the WACO affair they come with the govt paranoia
bit. It's like they reserve their ability to criticise the govt for 
when they feel their interests are threatened but don't give a cuss about
anyone else.

You should revers that attitude. When your interests are threatened its
way too late. You have to challenge the govt when it is attacking
someone else's interests. 

That does not mean however that you can start calling the govt the 
equivalent of the NAZI party on the basis of an unfortunate outcome
in a hostage situation.

Judging from past experience (the '87 March, a Peace and Justice March the 
same year, and 3 different Pro-coice Marches), The Park Service will come out
with an estimate that is approximately 1/2 the estimate that organizers will
come up with - though the last Choice march I went to had a sign-in system, 
and the numbers ended up closer.  And then you've got the media types in their
helicopters, rolling dice.

I believe the MOW plans and handing out some sort of wristband thingy, and 
basing their count on those.  I see two problems with this.  One, can they 
get *everybody* to take one (and only one)?  Two, they couldn't possibly have
been able to choose a color/design that won't clash with *somebody's* outfit!

Hmm...  Tell me, did you go to the Mickey Mouse school of logic?  You have
just stated that there are not many homosexuals as Kinsey reported in his
survey (and the surveys of the Kinsey Institute since).  Then you say that
the reason many young people are promiscuous is because homosexuals form
a large part of that group, or there are some homosexuals whose lives 
consist of having sex, with no gaps for eating &c.  Using *your* logic
it would seem to suggest that on average gay men have about 2000 partners each
a week!  Try to think through your arguments carefully.  Or then again, not,
because I like to laugh every now and then.

This depends on the premise that there are only three types of behaviour: gay, bi
and hetero.  This has yet to be proved.  See an earlier post about the Kinsey
Institute of grading.  This, although rough, seems more logical.  Also you use
"this would show", defining a fact and not an assumption.  Again, back your 
statements or shut up.

Your post is based on the premise that the laws as they stand do not
discriminate anybody, so your argument falls over immediately.  Are you
really that dumb as to use emotive language to prove an argument?
Please feel free to answer, that is, if you have anything intelligent
to say on the matter.

Excuse me a moment when I laugh my head off...  I defy you to prove

argument, once again, Mr Logic(NOT!), falls flat on its face.

Take a course in civil behaviour and logic.  Then come back and defend

  What crap, Phil. 50mm? Wrong. To give you a clue as to how big 50mm is, the
 F-16 fighter aircraft have 20mm gattling guns used to shoot down other 
 aircraft. A 50mm gun would be somewhere in the `cannon' realm. They might
 have had .50 calibre but definitely not 50mm.

Good grief!  I do believe that for once you may have an argument which may
be discussed intelligently!

I guess that you are a person who dislikes contact with people of ethnic
minority.  However, your argument again falls flat on its face.  You state
that you, under an anti-discrimination bill, would be forced to associate
with others [homosexuals, I assume] against your will.  How do you know that
you do not associate with them now, except they may be closeted?   Would you
like to change your argument to read "forced to associate with truthfully
homosexual people against my will"?  You have no proof that anyone you
now know may not be homosexual and this punches a large hole in your
argument.  Is it your belief that a homosexual comes in only one flavour (sic)
and that is the camp mincing type?  Prove it.  You cannot.

I must admit though, that it looks as if you actually thought about your response
this time instead of just raving.

Hey, Clayton, it's me again!  I just love your arguments.  They completely

Hehehe!  Dontcha just love these carefully constructed arguements?

Clayton, babe, please define the word `molest`.  Are you using a legal
term or a proper dictionary term?  Molest, as far as I can remember, means
`to do damage to person(s)`.  My mate, Mike, was lured into a woman's parlour
when he was 14.  Is that molestation?  A number of my friends (straight) lost
their virginity before that.  Were they 'molested'?  They told me that they
thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  I see no damage.  

Please stop pushing your objective morality on others.  If you push, people won't
fall over and say 'Ye gads, you're right!', they'll just push back.

Have you signed up for that logic course yet?

The above conveniently ignores the murder of four BATF agents by the
Branch Davidians in an unprovoked ambush.

Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy. There are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated. They set out to obtain a legal warrant and 
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell.

The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked
assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish. Had they
expected the B-D to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one.

The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police. 


If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing
the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
hear it.

This story was in the LA Times a few months ago.
The Clinton administration is exploring every avenue of
"revenue enhancement", but not all will be chosen.

There was a funny cartoon in Sunday's NY Times: "Bill
Clinton's Calendar".  Every day was April 15.

Although I can understand why you think the comparison might be valid,
I would have to disagree. The Jews who found themselves alone against
Rome on Masada faced a future which was infinitely bleaker than the one
faced by the Branch Davidians. The latter, in reality, would likely
have been charged with weapons violations and other sorts of crimes.
Most of them would have likely gotten off entirely. It is highly
unlikely that anyone other than Vernon Howell would have been been
imprisoned for very long. But regardless, most of the people, and
certainly all of the children, would have been allowed to leave, and if
they so chose, join another cult.

The Jews on Masada well understood their likely fate from what had
already happened. Had they surrendered, the men of fighting age would
probably have been put to death, perhaps crucified.  The women and
children would have been enslaved. None of them would have been likely
to practice their religion again.

I understand that Howell/Koresh and perhaps others will argue that the
fate of the Branch Davidians was "equally" onerous and that they were
fighting for religious freedom. I guest that's a judgement call...

   A person sees the front of their home is strewn with garbage. That
person removes the trash, and sweeps the sidewalk. His next door neigh-
bors have not. The person then approaches his two neighbors and talks
to them about cleaning the front of their homes, and why it would be
good for their own living conditions, and that of the neighborhood.
   There's nothing wrong with holding your neighbors accountable for
their actions. That is the basis for a viable, safe community.
