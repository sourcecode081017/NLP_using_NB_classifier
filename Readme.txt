----------------------------------Multinomial NB Classifier-------------------------

IDE USED: Spyder IDE, Programming lang - python 3.6
Prerequsites to run the program:

python 3.6
*NLTK library is required.

*nltk.download() command was used in the Console to download and install NLTK  

*This was used to filter out gibberish words and stop words.

*Please do not change the folder names/filenames or the directory hierarchy of the folders. 
This is because the program uses fixed directory structure and folder names
.
-----------------------------Running the Program---------------------------------- 

Run the MultinomialNB.py file

The program approximately take 20 mins  to run,and the prediction out can be seen in any ipython console as the program is running. 
This is because 9997 test documents were used to make prediction and each document is passed into the Naive bayes classifier, 
in a Naive approach without any libraries like sk-learn or tensorFlow.
